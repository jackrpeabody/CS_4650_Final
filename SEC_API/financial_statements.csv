Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) 

Note 1 &#8211; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

Basis of Presentation and Preparation 

The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively &#8220;Apple&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;). Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. In the opinion of the Company&#8217;s management, the condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, which are normal and recurring in nature, necessary for fair financial statement presentation. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Certain prior period amounts in the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been reclassified to conform to the current period&#8217;s presentation. These condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes should be read in conjunction with the Company&#8217;s annual consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 24, 2022. 

The Company&#8217;s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company&#8217;s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the first fiscal quarter of 2023. The Company&#8217;s fiscal years 2023 and 2022 span 53 and 52 weeks, respectively. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the Company&#8217;s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years. 

Earnings Per Share 

The following table shows the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for the three- and six-month periods ended April 1, 2023 and March 26, 2022 (net income in millions and shares in thousands): 

Three Months Ended Six Months Ended April 1, 2023 March 26, 2022 April 1, 2023 March 26, 2022 Numerator: Net income $ 24,160 &#160; $ 25,010 &#160; $ 54,158 &#160; $ 59,640 &#160; Denominator: Weighted-average basic shares outstanding 15,787,154 &#160; 16,278,802 &#160; 15,839,939 &#160; 16,335,263 &#160; Effect of dilutive securities 59,896 &#160; 124,514 &#160; 61,445 &#160; 126,041 &#160; Weighted-average diluted shares 15,847,050 &#160; 16,403,316 &#160; 15,901,384 &#160; 16,461,304 &#160; Basic earnings per share $ 1.53 &#160; $ 1.54 &#160; $ 3.42 &#160; $ 3.65 &#160; Diluted earnings per share $ 1.52 &#160; $ 1.52 &#160; $ 3.41 &#160; $ 3.62 &#160; 

Approximately 48 million restricted stock units (&#8220;RSUs&#8221;) were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share for the six months ended April 1, 2023 because their effect would have been antidilutive.

Total net sales include $ 3.5 billion of revenue recognized in the three months ended April 1, 2023 that was included in deferred revenue as of December 31, 2022, $ 3.0 billion of revenue recognized in the three months ended March 26, 2022 that was included in deferred revenue as of December 25, 2021, $ 5.5 billion of revenue recognized in the six months ended April 1, 2023 that was included in deferred revenue as of September 24, 2022, and $ 4.8 billion of revenue recognized in the six months ended March 26, 2022 that was included in deferred revenue as of September 25, 2021. 

The Company&#8217;s proportion of net sales by disaggregated revenue source was generally consistent for each reportable segment in Note 10, &#8220;Segment Information and Geographic Data&#8221; for the three- and six-month periods ended April 1, 2023 and March 26, 2022, except in Greater China, where iPhone revenue represented a moderately higher proportion of net sales. 

As of April 1, 2023 and September 24, 2022, the Company had total deferred revenue of $ 12.5 billion and $ 12.4 billion, respectively. As of April 1, 2023, the Company expects 65 % of total deferred revenue to be realized in less than a year, 26 % within one-to-two years, 7 % within two-to-three years and 2 % in greater than three years.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging 

The Company may use derivative instruments to partially offset its business exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risk. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons, including accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign exchange or interest rates. 

Foreign Exchange Risk 

To protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into forward contracts, option contracts or other instruments, and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months. 

To protect the Company&#8217;s foreign currency&#8211;denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into forward contracts, cross-currency swaps or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of April 1, 2023, the maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for term debt&#8211;related foreign currency transactions is 19 years. 

Apple Inc. | Q2 2023 Form 10-Q | 8 

The Company may also enter into derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges to protect gross margins from certain fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, as well as to offset a portion of the foreign currency exchange gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies. 

Interest Rate Risk 

To protect the Company&#8217;s term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps, options or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. 

The notional amounts of the Company&#8217;s outstanding derivative instruments as of April 1, 2023 and September 24, 2022 were as follows (in millions): 

April 1, 2023 September 24, 2022 Derivative instruments designated as accounting hedges: Foreign exchange contracts $ 51,119 &#160; $ 102,670 &#160; Interest rate contracts $ 19,375 &#160; $ 20,125 &#160; Derivative instruments not designated as accounting hedges: Foreign exchange contracts $ 111,696 &#160; $ 185,381 &#160; 

The gross fair values of the Company&#8217;s derivative assets and liabilities as of September 24, 2022 were as follows (in millions): 

September 24, 2022 Fair Value of Derivatives Designated as Accounting Hedges Fair Value of Derivatives Not Designated as Accounting Hedges Total Fair Value 

Derivative assets (1) : 

Foreign exchange contracts $ 4,317 &#160; $ 2,819 &#160; $ 7,136 &#160; 

Derivative liabilities (2) : 

Foreign exchange contracts $ 2,205 &#160; $ 2,547 &#160; $ 4,752 &#160; Interest rate contracts $ 1,367 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 1,367 &#160; 

(1) Derivative assets are measured using Level 2 fair value inputs and are included in other current assets and other non-current assets in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. 

(2) Derivative liabilities are measured using Level 2 fair value inputs and are included in other current liabilities and other non-current liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. 

The derivative assets above represent the Company&#8217;s gross credit exposure if all counterparties failed to perform. To mitigate credit risk, the Company generally enters into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair values of certain derivatives fluctuate from contractually established thresholds. To further limit credit risk, the Company generally enters into master netting arrangements with the respective counterparties to the Company&#8217;s derivative contracts, under which the Company is allowed to settle transactions with a single net amount payable by one party to the other. As of September 24, 2022, the potential effects of these rights of set-off associated with the Company&#8217;s derivative contracts, including the effects of collateral, would be a reduction to both derivative assets and derivative liabilities of $ 7.8 billion, resulting in a net derivative asset of $ 412 million. 

The carrying amounts of the Company&#8217;s hedged items in fair value hedges as of April 1, 2023 and September 24, 2022 were as follows (in millions): 

April 1, 2023 September 24, 2022 Hedged assets/(liabilities): Current and non-current marketable securities $ 14,651 &#160; $ 13,378 &#160; Current and non-current term debt $ ( 18,249 ) $ ( 18,739 )

Accounts Receivable 

Trade Receivables 

The Company has considerable trade receivables outstanding with its third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers, resellers, small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. The Company generally does not require collateral from its customers; however, the Company will require collateral or third-party credit support in certain instances to limit credit risk. In addition, when possible, the Company attempts to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers or by requiring third-party financing, loans or leases to support credit exposure. These credit-financing arrangements are directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company generally does not assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements. 

As of both April 1, 2023 and September 24, 2022, the Company had one customer that represented 10% or more of total trade receivables, which accounted for 10 % . The Company&#8217;s cellular network carriers accounted for 32 % and 44 % of total trade receivables as of April 1, 2023 and September 24, 2022, respectively. 

Vendor Non-Trade Receivables 

The Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of components to these vendors who manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company purchases these components directly from suppliers. As of April 1, 2023, the Company had three vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 43 %, 19 % and 13 %. As of September 24, 2022, the Company had two vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 54 % and 13 %.

Note 5 &#8211; Income Taxes 

European Commission State Aid Decision 

On August 30, 2016, the European Commission announced its decision that Ireland granted state aid to the Company by providing tax opinions in 1991 and 2007 concerning the tax allocation of profits of the Irish branches of two subsidiaries of the Company (the &#8220;State Aid Decision&#8221;). The State Aid Decision ordered Ireland to calculate and recover additional taxes from the Company for the period June 2003 through December 2014. Irish legislative changes, effective as of January 2015, eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that date forward. The Company and Ireland appealed the State Aid Decision to the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union (the &#8220;General Court&#8221;). On July 15, 2020, the General Court annulled the State Aid Decision. On September 25, 2020, the European Commission appealed the General Court&#8217;s decision to the European Court of Justice and a hearing has been scheduled for May 23, 2023. The Company believes it would be eligible to claim a U.S. foreign tax credit for a portion of any incremental Irish corporate income taxes potentially due related to the State Aid Decision.

Note 9 &#8211; Commitments and Contingencies 

Unconditional Purchase Obligations 

The Company has entered into certain off&#8211;balance sheet commitments that require the future purchase of goods or services (&#8220;unconditional purchase obligations&#8221;). The Company&#8217;s unconditional purchase obligations primarily consist of supplier arrangements, licensed content and distribution rights.

2023 (remaining six months) $ 2,263 &#160; 2024 2,716 &#160; 2025 2,028 &#160; 2026 2,602 &#160; 2027 571 &#160; Thereafter 5,897 &#160; Total $ 16,077 &#160; 

Contingencies 

The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and that have not been fully resolved. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims.

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

(unaudited) 

NOTE 1 &#8212; OVERVIEW AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION 

Dell Technologies Inc. is a leading global end-to-end technology provider that designs, develops, manufactures, markets, sells, and supports a wide range of comprehensive and integrated solutions, products, and services. Dell Technologies offerings include servers and networking, storage, cloud solutions, desktops, notebooks, services, software, and third-party software and peripherals. References in these Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements to the &#8220;Company&#8221; or &#8220;Dell Technologies&#8221; mean Dell Technologies Inc. individually and together with its consolidated subsidiaries. 

Basis of Presentation &#8212; The accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (&#8220;SEC&#8221;) in the Company&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2022. These Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;). In the opinion of management, the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements reflect all adjustments of a normal recurring nature considered necessary to fairly state the financial position of the Company as of October 28, 2022 and January 28, 2022, the results of its operations, corresponding comprehensive income, statement of stockholders&#8217; equity for the three and nine months ended October 28, 2022 and October 29, 2021, and cash flows for the nine months ended October 28, 2022 and October 29, 2021. 

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that 

affect the amounts reported in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying Notes. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. The results of its operations, corresponding comprehensive income, statement of stockholders&#8217; equity for the three and nine months ended October 28, 2022 and October 29, 2021, and cash flows for the nine months ended October 28, 2022 and October 29, 2021 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full fiscal year or for any other fiscal period. 

The Company&#8217;s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period ending on the Friday nearest January 31. The fiscal year ended January 28, 2022 (&#8220;Fiscal 2022&#8221;) was a 52-week period while the fiscal year ending February 3, 2023 (&#8220;Fiscal 2023&#8221;) will be a 53-week period. 

Principles of Consolidation &#8212; These Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Dell Technologies Inc., its wholly-owned subsidiaries, and the accounts of SecureWorks Corp. (&#8220;Secureworks&#8221;), which is majority-owned by Dell Technologies. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated. 

Secureworks &#8212; As of October 28, 2022 and January 28, 2022, the Company held approximately 82.7 % and 83.9 %, respectively, of the outstanding equity interest in Secureworks, excluding restricted stock awards (&#8220;RSAs&#8221;), and approximately 82.7 % and 83.1 %, respectively, of the equity interest, including RSAs. The portion of the results of operations of Secureworks allocable to its other owners is shown as net income (loss) attributable to the non-controlling interests in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income, as an adjustment to net income attributable to Dell Technologies stockholders. The non-controlling interests&#8217; share of equity in Secureworks is reflected as a component of the non-controlling interests in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Position and was $ 101 million and $ 105 million as of October 28, 2022 and January 28, 2022, respectively. 

Variable Interest Entities &#8212; The Company also consolidates Variable Interest Entities (""VIEs"") where it has been determined that the Company is the primary beneficiary of the applicable entities&#8217; operations. For each VIE, the primary beneficiary is the party that has both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the VIE that could potentially be significant to such VIE. In evaluating whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of each entity, the Company evaluates its power to direct the most significant activities of the VIE by considering the purpose and design of each entity and the risks each entity was designed to create and pass through to its respective variable interest holders. The Company also evaluates its economic interests in each of the VIEs. See Note 5 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding consolidated VIEs.

(NYSE: VMW) (individually and together with its consolidated subsidiaries, &#8220;VMware&#8221;) by means of a special stock dividend (the &#8220;VMware Spin-off&#8221;). The VMware Spin-off was effectuated pursuant to a Separation and Distribution Agreement, dated as of April 14, 2021, between Dell Technologies and VMware (the &#8220;Separation and Distribution Agreement&#8221;). 

Pursuant to the Commercial Framework Agreement (the &#8220;CFA&#8221;) between Dell Technologies and VMware, Dell Technologies continues to act as a distributor of VMware&#8217;s standalone products and services and purchase such products and services for resale to customers. Dell Technologies also continues to integrate VMware&#8217;s products and services with Dell Technologies&#8217; offerings and sell them to customers. The results of such operations are presented as continuing operations within the Company&#8217;s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income for all periods presented. 

In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, the results of VMware, excluding Dell Technologies' resale of VMware offerings, are presented as discontinued operations in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and, as such, have been excluded from both continuing operations and segment results for the three and nine months ended October 29, 2021. The Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows are presented on a consolidated basis for both continuing operations and discontinued operations. See Note 2 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the VMware Spin-off. 

Boomi Divestiture &#8212; On October 1, 2021, Dell Technologies completed the sale of Boomi, Inc. (&#8220;Boomi&#8221;) and certain related assets. At the completion of the sale, the Company received total cash consideration of approximately $ 4.0 billion, resulting in a pre-tax gain on sale of $ 4.0 billion recognized in interest and other, net on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. The Company ultimately recorded a $ 3.0 billion gain, net of $ 1.0 billion in tax expense. The transaction was intended to support general corporate purposes and fuel growth initiatives through targeted investments to modernize Dell Technologies&#8217; core infrastructure and by expanding in high-priority areas, including hybrid and private cloud, edge, telecommunications solutions, and the Company&#8217;s Dell APEX offerings. Prior to the divestiture, Boomi&#8217;s operating results were included within other businesses and the divestiture did not qualify for presentation as a discontinued operation. 

Other Events &#8212; During the nine months ended October 28, 2022, Dell Technologies recognized $ 181 million in costs associated with exiting the Company&#8217;s business in Russia, primarily related to asset impairments and other exit related costs. 

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 

Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers &#8212; In October 2021, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#8220;FASB&#8221;) issued guidance which requires companies to apply Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities from contracts with customers acquired in a business combination. Public entities must adopt the new guidance for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022 and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. Adoption of the guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s financial results. 

Reference Rate Reform &#8212; In March 2020, the FASB issued guidance which provides temporary optional expedients and exceptions to GAAP guidance on contract modifications and certain hedging relationships to ease the financial reporting burdens related to the expected market transition from the London Interbank Offered Rate to alternative reference rates. The Company may elect to apply the amendments prospectively through December 31, 2024. Adoption of the new guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s financial results.

NOTE 2 &#8212; DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS 

VMware Spin-Off &#8212; As disclosed in Note 1 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, on November 1, 2021, the Company completed its spin-off of VMware by means of a special stock dividend of 30,678,605 shares of Class A common stock and 307,221,836 shares of Class B common stock of VMware to Dell Technologies stockholders of record as of October 29, 2021. 

Prior to receipt of the VMware common stock by the Company&#8217;s stockholders, each share of VMware Class B common stock automatically converted into one share of VMware Class A common stock. As a result of these transactions, each holder of record of shares of Dell Technologies common stock as of the distribution record date received approximately 0.440626 of a share of VMware Class A common stock for each share of Dell Technologies common stock held as of such date, based on shares outstanding as of the completion of the VMware Spin-off. Following completion of the transaction, the pre-transaction stockholders of Dell Technologies owned shares in two separate public companies, consisting of (1) VMware, which continues to own the businesses of VMware, Inc. and its subsidiaries, and (2) Dell Technologies, which continues to own Dell Technologies&#8217; other businesses and subsidiaries. After the separation, Dell Technologies does not beneficially own any shares of VMware common stock. 

VMware paid a cash dividend, pro rata, to each of the holders of VMware common stock in an aggregate amount equal to $ 11.5 billion, of which Dell Technologies received $ 9.3 billion. Following the payment by VMware to its stockholders, the separation of VMware from Dell Technologies occurred, including the termination or settlement of certain intercompany accounts and intercompany contracts. Dell Technologies used the net proceeds from its pro rata share of the cash dividend to repay a portion of its outstanding debt. 

Dell Technologies determined that the VMware Spin-off, and related distributions, qualified as tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes, which required significant judgment by management. In making these determinations, Dell Technologies applied U.S. federal tax law to relevant facts and circumstances and obtained a favorable private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service, a tax opinion, and other external tax advice related to the concluded tax treatment. If the completed transactions were to fail to qualify for tax-free treatment for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Company could be subject to significant liabilities, which could have material adverse impacts on the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in future reporting periods. 

In connection with and upon completion of the VMware Spin-off, Dell Technologies and VMware entered into various agreements that provide a framework for the relationship between the companies after the transaction, including, among others, a commercial framework agreement, a tax matters agreement, and a transition services agreement. 

The CFA referred to in Note 1 to the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements provides a framework under which the Company and VMware will continue their commercial relationship after the transaction, particularly with respect to projects mutually agreed by the parties as having the potential to accelerate the growth of an industry, product, service, or platform that may provide one or both companies with a strategic market opportunity. The CFA has an initial term of five years , with automatic one-year renewals occurring annually thereafter, subject to certain terms and conditions. 

Pursuant to the CFA, Dell Technologies continues to act as a distributor of VMware&#8217;s standalone products and services and purchases such products and services for resale to end-user customers. Dell Technologies also continues to integrate VMware&#8217;s products and services with Dell Technologies&#8217; offerings and sell them to end users. Cash flows between Dell Technologies and VMware primarily relate to such transactions. The Company has determined that it is generally acting as principal in these arrangements. The results of such operations are classified as continuing operations within the Company&#8217;s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. See Note 16 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding transactions between Dell Technologies and VMware. 

In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, the results of VMware, excluding Dell Technologies&#8217; resale of VMware offerings, are presented as discontinued operations in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and, as such, have been excluded from both continuing operations and segment results for the three and nine months ended October 29, 2021. The Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows are presented on a consolidated basis for both continuing operations and discontinued operations.

The following section describes the valuation methodologies the Company uses to measure financial instruments at fair value: 

Money Market Funds &#8212; The Company&#8217;s investment in money market funds that are classified as cash equivalents hold underlying investments with a weighted average maturity of 90 days or less and are recognized at fair value. The valuations of these securities are based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets, when available, or pricing models whereby all significant inputs are observable or can be derived from or corroborated by observable market data. The Company reviews security pricing and assesses liquidity on a quarterly basis. 

Marketable Equity and Other Securities &#8212; The majority of the Company&#8217;s investments in equity and other securities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis consist of strategic investments in publicly-traded companies. The valuation of these securities is based on quoted prices in active markets. 

Derivative Instruments &#8212; The Company&#8217;s derivative financial instruments consist primarily of foreign currency forward and purchased option contracts and interest rate swaps. The fair value of the portfolio is determined using valuation models based on market observable inputs, including interest rate curves, forward and spot prices for currencies, and implied volatilities. Credit risk is also factored into the fair value calculation of the Company&#8217;s derivative financial instrument portfolio. See Note 8 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the Company&#8217;s derivative financial instrument activities. 

Deferred Compensation Plans &#8212;The Company offers deferred compensation plans for eligible employees, which allow participants to defer a portion of their compensation. Assets were the same as liabilities associated with the plans at approximately $ 166 million and $ 192 million as of October 28, 2022 and January 28, 2022, respectively, and are included in other assets and other liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. The net impact to the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income is not material since changes in the fair value of the assets substantially offset changes in the fair value of the liabilities. As such, assets and liabilities associated with these plans have not been included in the recurring fair value table above.

(unaudited) 

Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis &#8212; Certain assets are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis and therefore are not included in the recurring fair value table above. These assets consist primarily of non-financial assets such as goodwill and intangible assets. See Note 9 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about goodwill and intangible assets. 

As of October 28, 2022 and January 28, 2022, the Company held strategic investments in non-marketable equity and other securities of $ 1.3 billion and $ 1.4 billion, respectively. As these investments represent early-stage companies without readily determinable fair values, they are not included in the recurring fair value table above. See Note 4 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about our strategic investments. 

Carrying Value and Estimated Fair Value of Outstanding Debt &#8212; The following table presents the carrying value and estimated fair value of the Company&#8217;s outstanding debt as described in Note 7 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, including the current portion, as of the dates indicated: 

October 28, 2022 January 28, 2022 Carrying Value Fair Value Carrying Value Fair Value (in billions) Senior Notes $ 16.2 &#160; $ 15.3 &#160; $ 16.1 &#160; $ 18.5 &#160; Legacy Notes and Debentures $ 0.9 &#160; $ 0.9 &#160; $ 0.8 &#160; $ 1.1 &#160; 

The fair values of the outstanding debt shown in the table above, as well as the DFS debt described in Note 5 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, were determined based on observable market prices in a less active market or based on valuation methodologies using observable inputs and were categorized as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. The carrying value of DFS debt approximates fair value.

NOTE 4 &#8212; INVESTMENTS 

The Company has strategic investments in equity and other securities as well as investments in fixed income debt securities. All equity and other securities as well as long-term fixed income debt securities are recorded as long-term investments in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Short-term fixed income debt securities are recorded as other current assets in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. 

As of October 28, 2022 and January 28, 2022, total investments were $ 1.6 billion and $ 1.8 billion, respectively. 

Equity and Other Securities 

Equity and other securities include strategic investments in marketable and non-marketable securities. Investments in marketable securities are measured at fair value on a recurring basis. The Company has elected to apply the measurement alternative for non-marketable securities. Under the alternative, the Company measures investments without readily determinable fair values at cost, less impairment, adjusted by observable price changes. The Company makes a separate election to use the alternative for each eligible investment and is required to reassess at each reporting period whether an investment qualifies for the alternative. In evaluating these investments for impairment or observable price changes, the Company uses inputs including pre- and post-money valuations of recent financing events and the impact of those events on its fully diluted ownership percentages, as well as other available information regarding the issuer&#8217;s historical and forecasted performance. 

Carrying Value of Equity and Other Securities 

The following table presents the cost, cumulative unrealized gains, cumulative unrealized losses, and carrying value of the Company's strategic investments in marketable and non-marketable equity securities as of the dates indicated:

Gains and Losses on Equity and Other Securities 

The following table presents unrealized gains and losses on marketable and non-marketable equity and other securities for the periods indicated:

(a) For the three and nine months ended October 28, 2022, net unrealized losses on non-marketable securities were primarily attributable to the recognition of impairments on equity and other securities, which were generally in line with extended public equity market declines. In evaluating these investments for impairment, the Company used inputs including pre- and post-money valuations of recent financing events and the impact of those events on its fully diluted ownership percentages, as well as other available information regarding the issuer&#8217;s historical and forecasted performance. 

(b) For the three and nine months ended October 29, 2021, net unrealized gains on non-marketable securities were due to upward adjustments for observable price changes offset by losses primarily attributable to downward adjustments for observable price changes. 

Fixed Income Debt Securities 

The Company has fixed income debt securities carried at amortized cost which are held as collateral for borrowings. The Company intends to hold the investments to maturity.

NOTE 5 &#8212; FINANCIAL SERVICES 

The Company offers or arranges various financing options and services and alternative payment structures for its customers globally primarily through Dell Financial Services and its affiliates (&#8220;DFS&#8221;). The Company also arranges financing for some of its customers in various countries where DFS does not currently operate as a captive enterprise. The key activities of DFS include originating, collecting, and servicing customer financing arrangements primarily related to the purchase or use of Dell Technologies products and services. In some cases, DFS also offers financing for the purchase of third-party technology products that complement the Dell Technologies portfolio of products and services. New financing originations were $ 2.3 billion and $ 2.0 billion for the three months ended October 28, 2022 and October 29, 2021, respectively, and $ 6.7 billion and $ 5.8 billion for the nine months ended October 28, 2022 and October 29, 2021, respectively. 

The Company&#8217;s lease and loan arrangements with customers are aggregated primarily into the following categories: 

Revolving loans &#8212; Revolving loans offered under private label credit financing programs provide qualified customers with a revolving credit line for the purchase of products and services offered by Dell Technologies. These private label credit financing programs are referred to as Dell Preferred Account (&#8220;DPA&#8221;) and Dell Business Credit (&#8220;DBC&#8221;). The DPA product is primarily offered to individual consumer customers, and the DBC product is primarily offered to small and medium-sized commercial customers. Revolving loans in the United States bear interest at a variable annual percentage rate that is tied to the prime rate. Based on historical payment patterns, revolving loan transactions are typically repaid within twelve months on average. Due to the short-term nature of the revolving loan portfolio, the carrying value of the portfolio approximates fair value. 

Fixed-term leases and loans &#8212; The Company enters into financing arrangements with customers who seek lease financing for equipment. DFS leases are generally classified as sales-type leases or operating leases. Leases with business customers have fixed terms of generally two to four years . 

The Company also offers fixed-term loans to qualified small businesses, large commercial accounts, governmental organizations, educational entities, and certain individual consumer customers. These loans are repaid in equal payments including interest and have defined terms of generally three to five years . The fair value of the fixed-term loan portfolio is determined using market observable inputs. The carrying value of these loans approximates fair value. 

The Company further strengthens customer relationships through flexible consumption models, including utility, subscription, and as-a-Service models, which enable the Company to offer its customers the option to pay over time to provide them with financial flexibility to meet their changing technological requirements.

Aging is likely to fluctuate as a result of the variability in volume of large transactions entered into over the period, and the administrative processes that accompany those transactions. Aging is also impacted by the timing of the Company&#8217;s fiscal period end date relative to calendar month-end customer payment due dates. As a result of these factors, fluctuations in aging from period to period do not necessarily indicate a material change in the collectibility of the portfolio. 

Fixed-term consumer and commercial customer receivables are placed on non-accrual status if principal or interest is past due and considered delinquent, or if there is concern about collectibility of a specific customer receivable. The receivables identified as doubtful for collectibility may be classified as current for aging purposes. Aged revolving portfolio customer receivables identified as delinquent are charged off.

The categories shown in the tables above segregate customer receivables based on the relative degrees of credit risk. The credit quality indicators for DPA revolving accounts are measured primarily as of each quarter-end date, while all other indicators are generally updated on a periodic basis. 

For DPA revolving receivables shown in the table above, the Company makes credit decisions based on proprietary scorecards, which include the customer&#8217;s credit history, payment history, credit usage, and other credit agency-related elements. The higher quality category includes prime accounts generally of a higher credit quality that are comparable to U.S. customer FICO scores of 720 or above. The mid category represents the mid-tier accounts that are comparable to U.S. customer FICO scores from 660 to 719. The lower category is generally sub-prime and represents lower credit quality accounts that are comparable to U.S. customer FICO scores below 660. For the DBC revolving receivables and fixed-term commercial receivables shown in the table above, an internal grading system is utilized that assigns a credit level score based on a number of considerations, including liquidity, operating performance, and industry outlook. The grading criteria and classifications for the fixed-term products differ from those for the revolving products as loss experience varies between these product and customer groups. The credit quality categories cannot be compared between the different classes as loss experience varies substantially between the classes.

DFS Debt 

The Company maintains programs that facilitate the funding of leases, loans, and other alternative payment structures in the capital markets. The majority of DFS debt is non-recourse to Dell Technologies and represents borrowings under securitization programs and structured financing programs, for which the Company&#8217;s risk of loss is limited to transferred loan and lease payments and associated equipment.

DFS U.S. Debt 

Asset-Based Financing and Securitization Facilities &#8212; The Company maintains separate asset-based financing facilities and a securitization facility in the United States, which are revolving facilities for fixed-term leases and loans and for revolving loans, respectively. This debt is collateralized solely by the U.S. loan and lease payments and associated equipment in the facilities. The debt has a variable interest rate, and the duration of the debt is based on the terms of the underlying loan and lease payment streams. As of October 28, 2022, the total debt capacity related to the U.S. asset-based financing and securitization facilities was $ 5.0 billion. The Company enters into interest swap agreements to effectively convert a portion of this debt from a floating rate to a fixed rate. See Note 8 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about interest rate swaps.

The Company&#8217;s U.S. securitization facility for revolving loans is effective through June 25, 2025. The Company&#8217;s two U.S. asset-based financing facilities for fixed-term leases and loans are effective through July 10, 2023 and June 21, 2024, respectively. 

The asset-based financing and securitization facilities contain standard structural features related to the performance of the funded receivables, which include defined credit losses, delinquencies, average credit scores, and minimum collection requirements. In the event one or more of these criteria are not met and the Company is unable to restructure the facility, no further funding of receivables will be permitted and the timing of the Company&#8217;s expected cash flows from over-collateralization will be delayed. As of October 28, 2022, these criteria were met. 

Fixed-Term Securitization Offerings &#8212; The Company periodically issues asset-backed debt securities under fixed-term securitization programs to private investors. The asset-backed debt securities are collateralized solely by the U.S. fixed-term leases and loans in the offerings, which are held by Special Purpose Entities (&#8220;SPEs&#8221;), as discussed below. The interest rate on these securities is fixed and ranges from 0.33 % to 5.92 % per annum, and the duration of these securities is based on the terms of the underlying lease and loan payment streams. 

DFS International Debt 

Securitization Facility &#8212; The Company maintains a securitization facility in Europe for fixed-term leases and loans. This facility is effective through December 21, 2022 and had a total debt capacity of $ 797 million as of October 28, 2022. Subsequent to October 28, 2022, the Company extended the term of this facility to be effective through December 21, 2024. 

The securitization facility contains standard structural features related to the performance of the securitized receivables, which include defined credit losses, delinquencies, average credit scores, and minimum collection requirements. In the event one or more of these criteria are not met and the Company is unable to restructure the program, no further funding of receivables will be permitted and the timing of the Company&#8217;s expected cash flows from over-collateralization will be delayed. As of October 28, 2022, these criteria were met.

Variable Interest Entities 

In connection with the asset-based financing facilities, securitization facilities, and fixed-term securitization offerings discussed above, the Company transfers certain U.S. and European lease and loan payments and associated equipment to SPEs that meet the definition of a VIE and are consolidated, along with the associated debt detailed above, into the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, as the Company is the primary beneficiary of the VIEs. The SPEs are bankruptcy-remote legal entities with separate assets and liabilities. The purpose of the SPEs is to facilitate the funding of customer loan and lease payments and associated equipment in the capital markets. 

Some of the SPEs have entered into financing arrangements with multi-seller conduits that, in turn, issue asset-backed debt securities in the capital markets. DFS debt outstanding held by the consolidated VIEs is collateralized by the lease and loan payments and associated equipment. The Company&#8217;s risk of loss related to securitized receivables is limited to the amount by which the Company&#8217;s right to receive collections for assets securitized exceeds the amount required to pay interest, principal, and fees and expenses related to the asset-backed securities. The Company provides credit enhancement to the securitization in the form of over-collateralization. 

The following table presents the assets and liabilities held by the consolidated VIEs as of the dates indicated, which are included in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Position: 

&#160; October 28, 2022 January 28, 2022 &#160; (in millions) Assets held by consolidated VIEs Other current assets $ 302 &#160; $ 535 &#160; Financing receivables, net of allowance Short-term $ 3,791 &#160; $ 3,368 &#160; Long-term $ 3,022 &#160; $ 3,141 &#160; Property, plant, and equipment, net $ 1,094 &#160; $ 945 &#160; Liabilities held by consolidated VIEs Debt, net of unamortized debt issuance costs Short-term $ 4,996 &#160; $ 4,560 &#160; Long-term $ 2,207 &#160; $ 2,235 &#160; 

Lease and loan payments and associated equipment transferred via securitization through SPEs were $ 1.6 billion and $ 1.4 billion for the three months ended October 28, 2022 and October 29, 2021, respectively, and $ 4.5 billion and $ 4.1 billion for the nine months ended October 28, 2022 and October 29, 2021, respectively. 

Customer Receivable Sales 

To manage certain concentrations of customer credit exposure, the Company may sell selected fixed-term customer receivables to unrelated third parties on a periodic basis, without recourse. The amount of customer receivables sold for this purpose was $ 431 million and $ 180 million for the nine months ended October 28, 2022 and October 29, 2021, respectively. The Company&#8217;s continuing involvement in these customer receivables is primarily limited to servicing arrangements.

NOTE 6 &#8212; LEASES 

The Company enters into leasing transactions in which the Company is the lessee. These lease contracts are typically classified as operating leases. The Company&#8217;s lease contracts are generally for office buildings used to conduct its business, and the determination of whether such contracts contain leases generally does not require significant estimates or judgments. The Company also leases certain global logistics warehouses, employee vehicles, and equipment. As of October 28, 2022, the remaining terms of the Company&#8217;s leases range from less than one month to approximately ten years . As of October 28, 2022 and January 28, 2022, there were no material finance leases for which the Company was a lessee. 

The Company also enters into leasing transactions in which the Company is the lessor, primarily through customer financing arrangements offered through DFS. DFS originates leases that are primarily classified as either sales-type leases or operating leases. See Note 5 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the Company&#8217;s lessor arrangements.

Legacy Notes and Debentures &#8212; The Company has outstanding unsecured notes and debentures (collectively, the &#8220;Legacy Notes and Debentures&#8221;) that were issued by Dell Inc. (&#8220;Dell&#8221;), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Dell Technologies Inc., prior to the acquisition of Dell by Dell Technologies Inc. in the going-private transaction that closed in October 2013. Interest on these borrowings is payable semiannually. 

DFS Debt &#8212; See Note 5 and Note 8 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, respectively, for discussion of DFS debt and the interest rate swap agreements that hedge a portion of that debt. 

2021 Revolving Credit Facility &#8212; As of October 28, 2022, the Company&#8217;s revolving credit facility, which was entered into on November 1, 2021 (the &#8220;2021 Revolving Credit Facility&#8221;), matures on November 1, 2026. This facility provides the Company with revolving commitments in an aggregate principal amount of $ 5.0 billion as of October 28, 2022 for general corporate purposes, including liquidity support for the Company&#8217;s commercial paper program, and includes a letter of credit sub-facility of up to $ 0.5 billion and a swing-line loan sub-facility of up to $ 0.5 billion. The 2021 Revolving Credit Facility also allows the Company to obtain incremental additional commitments on one or more occasions in minimum amounts of $ 10 million. 

Borrowings under the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to an applicable margin plus, at the borrowers&#8217; option, either (a) the specified London Interbank Offered Rate (&#8220;LIBOR&#8221;) or (b) a base rate. The margin applicable to LIBOR and base rate borrowings varies based upon the Company&#8217;s existing date ratings. The base rate is calculated based upon the greatest of the specified prime rate, the specified federal reserve bank rate, or LIBOR plus 1 %. The borrowers may voluntarily repay outstanding loans under the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility at any time without premium or penalty, other than customary breakage costs. 

As of October 28, 2022, available borrowings under the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility totaled $ 5.0 billion. 

Subsequent to October 28, 2022, the Company entered into an amendment to the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility to (i) transition from a LIBOR-based borrowing rate to a borrowing rate based on SOFR (Secured Overnight Financing Rate), (ii) extend the maturity date by one year to November 1, 2027, and (iii) increase the revolving commitments by $ 1.0 billion to an aggregate principal amount of $ 6.0 billion. The other terms of the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility remain unchanged. 

Covenants &#8212; The credit agreement governing the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility and the indentures governing the Senior Notes and the Legacy Notes and Debentures impose various limitations, subject to exceptions, on creating certain liens and entering into sale and lease-back transactions. The foregoing credit agreement and indentures contain customary events of default, including failure to make required payments, failure to comply with covenants, and the occurrence of certain events of bankruptcy and insolvency. The 2021 Revolving Credit Facility is also subject to an interest coverage ratio covenant that is tested at the end of each fiscal quarter with respect to the Company&#8217;s preceding four fiscal quarters. The Company was in compliance with this financial covenant as of October 28, 2022.

NOTE 8 &#8212; DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES 

As part of its risk management strategy, the Company uses derivative instruments, primarily foreign currency forward and option contracts and interest rate swaps, to hedge certain foreign currency and interest rate exposures, respectively. 

The Company&#8217;s objective is to offset gains and losses resulting from these exposures with gains and losses on the derivative contracts used to hedge the exposures, thereby reducing volatility of earnings and protecting the fair values of assets and liabilities. The earnings effects of the derivative instruments are presented in the same income statement line items as the earnings effects of the hedged items. For derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, the Company assesses hedge effectiveness both at the onset of the hedge and at regular intervals throughout the life of the derivative. The Company does not have any derivatives designated as fair value hedges. 

Foreign Exchange Risk 

The Company uses foreign currency forward and option contracts designated as cash flow hedges to protect against the foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in its forecasted transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Hedge accounting is applied based upon the criteria established by accounting guidance for derivative instruments and hedging activities. The risk of loss associated with purchased options is limited to premium amounts paid for the option contracts. The risk of loss associated with forward contracts is equal to the exchange rate differential from the time the contract is entered into until the time it is settled. The majority of these contracts typically expire in twelve months or less. 

During the three and nine months ended October 28, 2022 and October 29, 2021, the Company did not discontinue any cash flow hedges related to foreign exchange contracts that had a material impact on the Company&#8217;s results of operations due to the probability that the forecasted cash flows would not occur. 

The Company uses forward contracts to hedge monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency. These contracts generally expire in three months or less, are considered economic hedges, and are not designated for hedge accounting. The change in the fair value of these instruments represents a natural hedge as their gains and losses offset the changes in the underlying fair value of the monetary assets and liabilities due to movements in currency exchange rates. 

In connection with DFS operations in Europe, forward contracts are used to hedge financing receivables denominated in foreign currencies other than Euro. These contracts are not designated for hedge accounting and most expire within three years or less. 

Interest Rate Risk 

The Company uses interest rate swaps to hedge the variability in cash flows related to the interest rate payments on structured financing debt. The interest rate swaps economically convert the variable rate on the structured financing debt to a fixed interest rate to match the underlying fixed rate being received on fixed-term customer leases and loans. These contracts are not designated for hedge accounting and most expire within four years or less. 

Interest rate swaps are utilized to manage the interest rate risk, at a portfolio level, associated with DFS operations in Europe. The interest rate swaps economically convert the fixed rate on financing receivables to a three-month Euribor floating rate in order to match the floating rate nature of the banks&#8217; funding pool. These contracts are not designated for hedge accounting and most expire within five years or less. 

The Company utilizes cross-currency amortizing swaps to hedge the currency and interest rate risk exposure associated with the European securitization program. The cross-currency swaps combine a Euro-based interest rate swap with a British Pound or U.S. Dollar foreign exchange forward contract in which the Company pays a fixed or floating British Pound or U.S. Dollar amount and receives a fixed or floating amount in Euros linked to the one-month Euribor. The notional value of the swaps amortizes in line with the expected cash flows and run-off of the securitized assets. The swaps are not designated for hedge accounting and expire within five years or less.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets Impairment Testing 

Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually during the third fiscal quarter and whenever events or circumstances may indicate that an impairment has occurred. 

For the annual impairment review during the three months ended October 28, 2022, the Company elected to bypass the assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether it was more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit was less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. In electing to bypass the qualitative assessment, the Company proceeded directly to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test to measure the fair value of each goodwill reporting unit relative to its carrying amount, and to determine the amount of goodwill impairment loss to be recognized, if any. 

Management exercised significant judgment related to the above assessment, including the identification of goodwill reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to goodwill reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each goodwill reporting unit. The fair value of each goodwill reporting unit is generally estimated using a combination of public company multiples and discounted cash flow methodologies. The discounted cash flow and public company multiples methodologies require significant judgment, including estimation of future revenues, gross margins, and operating expenses, which are dependent on internal forecasts, current and anticipated economic conditions and trends, selection of market multiples through assessment of the reporting unit&#8217;s performance relative to peer competitors, the estimation of the long-term revenue growth rate and discount rate of the Company&#8217;s business, and the determination of the Company&#8217;s weighted average cost of capital. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the fair value of the goodwill reporting unit, potentially resulting in a non-cash impairment charge. 

The fair value of the indefinite-lived trade names is generally estimated using discounted cash flow methodologies. These methodologies require significant judgment, including estimation of future revenue, the estimation of the long-term revenue growth rate of the Company&#8217;s business and the determination of the Company&#8217;s weighted average cost of capital and royalty rates. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets, potentially resulting in a non-cash impairment charge. 

Based on the results of the annual impairment test performed during the three months ended October 28, 2022, the fair values of each of the reporting units exceeded their carrying values. No impairment test was performed during the nine months ended October 28, 2022 other than the Company&#8217;s annual impairment review.

NOTE 10 &#8212; DEFERRED REVENUE 

Deferred Revenue &#8212; Deferred revenue consists of support and deployment services, software maintenance, training, Software-as-a-Service, and undelivered hardware and professional services, consisting of installations and consulting engagements. Deferred revenue is recorded when the Company has invoiced or payments have been received for undelivered products or services where transfer of control has not occurred. Revenue is recognized as the Company&#8217;s performance obligations under the contract are completed. 

The following table presents the changes in the Company&#8217;s deferred revenue for the periods indicated: 

Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended October 28, 2022 October 29, 2021 October 28, 2022 October 29, 2021 (in millions) Deferred revenue: Deferred revenue at beginning of period $ 28,025 &#160; $ 26,668 &#160; $ 27,573 &#160; $ 25,592 &#160; Revenue deferrals 4,128 &#160; 4,459 &#160; 14,675 &#160; 15,048 &#160; Revenue recognized ( 5,064 ) ( 4,786 ) ( 14,994 ) ( 14,155 ) Other (a) &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; ( 165 ) ( 144 ) Deferred revenue at end of period $ 27,089 &#160; $ 26,341 &#160; $ 27,089 &#160; $ 26,341 &#160; Short-term deferred revenue $ 14,106 &#160; $ 13,426 &#160; $ 14,106 &#160; $ 13,426 &#160; Long-term deferred revenue $ 12,983 &#160; $ 12,915 &#160; $ 12,983 &#160; $ 12,915 &#160; 

____________________ 

(a) For the nine months ended October 28, 2022, Other represents the reclassification of deferred revenue to accrued and other liabilities. For the nine months ended October 29, 2021, Other consists of divested deferred revenue from the sale of Boomi. 

Remaining Performance Obligations &#8212; Remaining performance obligations represent the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to performance obligations not delivered, or partially undelivered, as of the end of the reporting period. Remaining performance obligations include deferred revenue plus unbilled amounts not yet recorded in deferred revenue. The value of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations as of October 28, 2022 was approximately $ 39 billion. The Company expects to recognize approximately 60 % of remaining performance obligations as revenue in the next twelve months , and the remainder thereafter. 

The aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations does not include amounts owed under cancelable contracts where there is no substantive termination penalty. The Company applied the practical expedient to exclude the value of remaining performance obligations for contracts for which revenue is recognized at the amount to which the Company has the right to invoice for services performed. 

Remaining performance obligation estimates are subject to change and are affected by several factors, including terminations, changes in the scope of contracts, periodic revalidation, adjustments for revenue that have not materialized, and adjustments for currency.

Pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement referred to below, Dell Technologies shares responsibility with VMware for certain matters, as indicated below, and VMware has agreed to indemnify Dell Technologies in whole or in part with respect to certain matters. 

The Company accrues a liability when it believes that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and that it can reasonably estimate the amount of the loss. The Company reviews these accruals at least quarterly and adjusts them to reflect ongoing negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and other relevant information. To the extent new information is obtained and the Company&#8217;s views on the probable outcomes of claims, suits, assessments, investigations, or legal proceedings change, changes in the Company&#8217;s accrued liabilities are recorded in the period in which such a determination is made. For some matters, the incurrence of a liability is not probable or the amount cannot be reasonably estimated and therefore accruals have not been made. 

The following is a discussion of the Company&#8217;s significant legal matters and other proceedings: 

Class Actions Related to the Class V Transaction &#160;&#8212; On December 28, 2018, the Company completed a transaction (the &#8220;Class V transaction&#8221;) in which it paid $ 14.0 billion in cash and issued 149,387,617 shares of its Class C Common Stock to holders of its Class V Common Stock in exchange for all outstanding shares of Class V Common Stock. As a result of the Class V transaction, the tracking stock feature of the Company&#8217;s capital structure associated with the Class V Common Stock was terminated. In November 2018, four purported stockholders brought putative class action complaints arising out of the Class V transaction. The actions were captioned Hallandale Beach Police and Fire Retirement Plan v. Michael Dell et al. (Civil Action No. 2018-0816-JTL), Howard Karp v. Michael Dell et al. (Civil Action No. 2019-0032-JTL), Miramar Police Officers&#8217; Retirement Plan v. Michael Dell et al. (Civil Action No. 2019-0049-JTL), and Steamfitters Local 449 Pension Plan v. Michael Dell et al. (Civil Action No. 2019-0115-JTL). The four actions were consolidated in the Delaware Chancery Court into In Re Dell Class V Litigation (Consol. C.A. No. 2018-0816-JTL). The suit currently names as defendants Michael S. Dell and certain of the other directors serving on the Board of Directors at the time of the Class V transaction, certain stockholders of the Company, consisting of Michael S. Dell and Silver Lake Group LLC and certain of its affiliated funds, and Goldman Sachs &#38; Co. LLC (&#8220;Goldman Sachs&#8221;), which served as financial advisor to the Company in connection with the Class V transaction. In an amended complaint filed in August 2019, the plaintiffs generally allege that the director and stockholder defendants breached their fiduciary duties under Delaware law to the former holders of Class V Common Stock in connection with the Class V transaction by offering a transaction value that was allegedly billions of dollars below the fair value. The plaintiffs contend that the offer understated the value of shares surrendered by the former stockholders, which the plaintiffs allege should have reflected higher alternative valuations, including a valuation related to the value of the shares of VMware, Inc. common stock, and that the difference in values was wrongfully appropriated by the stockholder defendants. On August 20, 2021, the plaintiffs added Goldman Sachs as a defendant and allege that it aided and abetted the alleged primary violations. In the complaint, the plaintiffs seek, among other remedies, a judicial declaration that the director and stockholder defendants breached their fiduciary duties. The plaintiffs also seek in the complaint disgorgement of all profits, benefits, and other compensation obtained by the defendants as a result of such alleged conduct and an award of unspecified damages, fees, and costs. The defendants filed a motion to dismiss the action in September 2019. The court denied the motion in June 2020. Trial was scheduled to begin on December 5, 2022. The Company is not a defendant in this action but is subject to director indemnification provisions under its certificate of incorporation and bylaws, and is a party to agreements with the defendants that contain indemnification

obligations of the Company, conditioned on the satisfaction of the requirements set forth in such agreements, relating to service as a director, ownership of the Company&#8217;s securities, and provision of services, as applicable. As described in Note 19 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, the plaintiffs and the defendants agreed to settle this action, subject to court approval, subsequent to October 28, 2022. 

Class Actions Related to VMware, Inc.&#8217;s Acquisition of Pivotal Software, Inc. &#8212; Two purported stockholders brought putative class action complaints arising out of VMware, Inc.&#8217;s acquisition of Pivotal Software, Inc. (&#8220;Pivotal&#8221;) on December 30, 2019. The two actions were consolidated in the Delaware Chancery Court into In re: Pivotal Software, Inc. Stockholders Litigation (Civil Action No. 2020-0440-KSJM). The complaint names as defendants the Company, VMware, Inc., Michael S. Dell, and certain officers of Pivotal. The plaintiffs generally allege that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties to the former holders of Pivotal Class A Common Stock in connection with VMware, Inc.&#8217;s acquisition of Pivotal by allegedly causing Pivotal to enter into a transaction that favored the interests of Pivotal&#8217;s controlling stockholders at the expense of such former stockholders. The parties reached a settlement on June 2, 2022, subject to court approval. On October 4, 2022, the court entered a final order and judgment approving the settlement. 

Other Litigation &#8212; Dell does not currently anticipate that any of the other various legal proceedings it is involved in will have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. 

In accordance with the relevant accounting guidance, the Company provides disclosures of matters where it is at least reasonably possible that the Company could experience a material loss exceeding the amounts already accrued for these or other proceedings or matters. In addition, the Company also discloses matters based on its consideration of other matters and qualitative factors, including the experience of other companies in the industry, and investor, customer, and employee relations considerations. As of October 28, 2022, the Company does not believe there is a reasonable possibility that a material loss exceeding the amounts already accrued for these or other proceedings or matters has been incurred. However, since the ultimate resolution of any such proceedings and matters is inherently unpredictable, the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows could be materially affected in any particular period by unfavorable outcomes in one or more of these proceedings or matters. Whether the outcome of any claim, suit, assessment, investigation, or legal proceeding, individually or collectively, could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows will depend on a number of factors, including the nature, timing, and amount of any associated expenses, amounts paid in settlement, damages, or other remedies or consequences. 

Indemnifications Obligations 

In the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into various contracts under which it may agree to indemnify other parties for losses incurred from certain events as defined in the relevant contract, such as litigation, regulatory penalties, or claims relating to past performance. Such indemnification obligations may not be subject to maximum loss clauses. Historically, payments related to these indemnification obligations have not been material to the Company. 

Under the Separation and Distribution Agreement described in Note 2 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, Dell Technologies has agreed to indemnify VMware, Inc., each of its subsidiaries and each of their respective directors, officers, and employees from and against all liabilities relating to, arising out of or resulting from, among other matters, the liabilities allocated to Dell Technologies as part of the separation of Dell Technologies and VMware and their respective businesses as a result of the VMware Spin-off (the &#8220;Separation&#8221;). VMware similarly has agreed to indemnify Dell Technologies Inc., each of its subsidiaries and each of their respective directors, officers, and employees from and against all liabilities relating to, arising out of or resulting from, among other matters, the liabilities allocated to VMware as part of the Separation. Dell Technologies expects VMware to fully perform under the terms of the Separation and Distribution Agreement. 

For information on the cross-indemnifications related to the tax matters agreement between the Company and VMware described in Note 2 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements effective upon the Separation on November 1, 2021, see Note 2 and Note 16 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

NOTE 12 &#8212; INCOME AND OTHER TAXES 

For the three months ended October 28, 2022, the Company&#8217;s effective income tax rate was 46.9 % on pre-tax income of $ 0.5 billion compared to 19.0 % on pre-tax income of $ 4.5 billion for the three months ended October 29, 2021. For the nine months ended October 28, 2022, the Company&#8217;s effective income tax rate was 21.1 % on pre-tax income of $ 2.3 billion compared to 16.7 % on pre-tax income of $ 6.0 billion for the nine months ended October 29, 2021. For both the three and nine months ended October 28, 2022, the changes in the Company&#8217;s effective tax rates were primarily attributable to changes in 

discrete tax items. The Company&#8217;s effective tax rate for both the three and nine months ended October 28, 2022 includes the impact of a $ 1.0 billion expense recognized in connection with an agreement to settle the Class V transaction litigation described in Note 11 and Note 19 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Other changes to the Company&#8217;s effective income tax rates were primarily driven by a change in the jurisdictional mix of income and higher U.S. tax on foreign operations, the effects of which were partially offset by higher benefits from foreign tax credits. 

Higher U.S. tax on foreign operations is attributable to the capitalization of research and development costs. Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was enacted on December 22, 2017, research and development costs incurred for tax years beginning after December 31, 2021 must be capitalized and amortized ratably over five or 15 years for tax purposes, depending on where the research activities are conducted. The Company&#8217;s effective income tax rate for the remaining quarter of Fiscal 2023 may be impacted by actions taken by the U.S. government to defer or repeal this provision, as well as by the actual mix of jurisdictions in which income is generated and the impact of any discrete tax items. 

The differences between the estimated effective income tax rates and the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% principally result from the Company&#8217;s geographical distribution of income, differences between the book and tax treatment of certain items, and discrete tax items. In certain jurisdictions, the Company&#8217;s tax rate is significantly less than the applicable statutory rate as a result of tax holidays. The majority of the Company&#8217;s foreign income that is subject to these tax holidays and lower tax rates is attributable to Singapore and China. A significant portion of these income tax benefits relate to a tax holiday that will be effective until January 31, 2029. The Company&#8217;s other tax holidays will expire in whole or in part during fiscal years 2030 through 2031. Many of these tax holidays and reduced tax rates may be extended when certain conditions are met or may be terminated early if certain conditions are not met. As of October 28, 2022, the Company was not aware of any matters of non-compliance related to these tax holidays. 

The Internal Revenue Service is currently conducting tax examinations of the Company for fiscal years 2015 through 2019. The Company is also currently under income tax audits in various state and foreign jurisdictions. The Company is undergoing negotiations, and in some cases contested proceedings, relating to tax matters with the taxing authorities in these jurisdictions. The Company believes that it has valid positions supporting its tax returns and that it has provided adequate reserves related to all matters contained in tax periods open to examination. Although the Company believes it has made adequate provisions for the uncertainties surrounding these audits, should the Company experience unfavorable outcomes, such outcomes could have a material impact on its results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. With respect to major U.S., state and foreign taxing jurisdictions, the Company is generally not subject to tax examinations for years prior to the fiscal year ended January 29, 2010. 

Judgment is required in evaluating the Company&#8217;s uncertain tax positions and determining the Company&#8217;s provision for income taxes. Unrecognized tax benefits were $ 1.2 billion as of both October 28, 2022 and January 28, 2022, and are included in other non-current liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. The Company does not anticipate a significant change to the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months. 

The Company takes certain non-income tax positions in the jurisdictions in which it operates and has received certain non-income tax assessments from various jurisdictions. The Company believes that a material loss in these matters is not probable and that it is not reasonably possible that a material loss exceeding amounts already accrued has been incurred. The Company believes its positions in these non-income tax litigation matters are supportable and that it ultimately will prevail in the matters. In the normal course of business, the Company&#8217;s positions and conclusions related to its non-income taxes could be challenged and assessments may be made. To the extent new information is obtained and the Company&#8217;s views on its positions, probable outcomes of assessments, or litigation change, changes in estimates to the Company&#8217;s accrued liabilities would be recorded in the period in which such a determination is made. In the resolution process for income tax and non-income tax audits, the Company is required in certain situations to provide collateral guarantees or indemnification to regulators and tax authorities until the matter is resolved.

NOTE 15 &#8212; EARNINGS PER SHARE 

Basic earnings per share is based on the weighted-average effect of all common shares issued and outstanding and is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted-average shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares used in the basic earnings per share calculation plus the number of common shares that would be issued assuming exercise or conversion of all potentially dilutive instruments. The Company excludes equity instruments from the calculation of diluted earnings per share if the effect of including such instruments is antidilutive. 

The following table presents basic and diluted earnings per share for the periods indicated:

NOTE 16 &#8212; RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 

VMware is considered to be a related party of the Company as a result of Michael Dell&#8217;s ownership interests in both Dell Technologies and VMware as well as Mr. Dell&#8217;s continued service as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Dell Technologies and as Chairman of the Board of VMware, Inc. See Note 1 and Note 2 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about the VMware Spin-off. 

The information provided below includes a summary of transactions with VMware. Transactions with related parties other than VMware during the periods presented were immaterial, individually and in aggregate. 

Transactions with VMware 

Dell Technologies and VMware engage in the following ongoing related party transactions: 

&#8226; Pursuant to original equipment manufacturer and reseller arrangements, Dell Technologies integrates or bundles VMware&#8217;s products and services with Dell Technologies&#8217; products and sells them to end-users. Dell Technologies also acts as a distributor, purchasing VMware&#8217;s standalone products and services for resale to end-user customers. Where applicable, costs under these arrangements are presented net of rebates received by Dell Technologies. 

&#8226; Dell Technologies procures products and services from VMware for its internal use. For the three and nine months ended October 28, 2022 and October 29, 2021, costs incurred associated with products and services purchased from VMware for internal use were immaterial. 

&#8226; Dell Technologies sells and leases products and sells services to VMware. For the three and nine months ended October 28, 2022 and October 29, 2021, revenue recognized from sales of services to VMware was immaterial. 

&#8226; DFS provides financing to certain VMware end users. Upon acceptance of the financing arrangement by both VMware&#8217;s end users and DFS, DFS recognizes amounts due to related parties on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Associated financing fees are recorded to product net revenue on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and are reflected within sales and leases of products to VMware in the table below. 

&#8226; Dell Technologies and VMware also enter into joint marketing, sales, and branding arrangements, for which both parties may incur costs. For the three and nine months ended October 28, 2022 and October 29, 2021, consideration received from VMware for joint marketing, sales, and branding arrangements was immaterial. 

&#8226; Dell Technologies and VMware enter into agreements to collaborate on technology projects in which one party pays the corresponding party for services or the reimbursement of costs. For the three and nine months ended October 28, 2022 and October 29, 2021, collaborative technology projects were immaterial. 

&#8226; Dell Technologies and VMware entered into a transition services agreement in connection with the VMware Spin-off to provide various support services, including investment advisory services, certain support services from Dell Technologies personnel, and other transitional services. Costs associated with this agreement were immaterial for the three and nine months ended October 28, 2022. 

&#8226; Prior to the completion of the VMware Spin-off, Dell Technologies provided support services and support from Dell Technologies personnel to VMware in certain geographic regions where VMware did not have an established legal entity. These employees were managed by VMware but Dell Technologies incurred the costs for these such services. The costs incurred by Dell Technologies on VMware&#8217;s behalf to these employees were charged to VMware. For the three and nine months ended October 29, 2021, costs associated with such seconded employees were immaterial. Remaining activity related to seconded employees occurring after the completion of the VMware Spin-off is governed by the transition services agreement discussed above.

The timing of the tax payments due to and from related parties is governed by the Tax Agreements. VMware&#8217;s portion of the mandatory one-time transition tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries (the &#8220;Transition Tax&#8221;) is governed by a letter agreement between VMware and Dell Technologies entered into on April 1, 2019. 

Net receipts from VMware pursuant to the Tax Agreements were immaterial during the three and nine months ended October 28, 2022 and October 29, 2021, and primarily relate to VMware&#8217;s portion of the Transition Tax, federal income taxes on Dell Technologies&#8217; consolidated tax return, and state tax payments for combined states. 

As a result of the activity under the Tax Agreements with VMware, amounts due from VMware were $ 569 million and $ 621 million as of October 28, 2022 and January 28, 2022, respectively, primarily related to VMware&#8217;s estimated tax obligation resulting from the Transition Tax.

NOTE 17 &#8212; SEGMENT INFORMATION 

The Company has two reportable segments that are based on the following business units: Infrastructure Solutions Group (&#8220;ISG&#8221;) and Client Solutions Group (&#8220;CSG&#8221;). 

ISG enables the digital transformation of the Company&#8217;s customers through its trusted multi-cloud and big data solutions, which are built upon a modern data center infrastructure. The ISG comprehensive portfolio of advanced storage solutions includes traditional storage solutions as well as next-generation storage solutions (such as all-flash arrays, scale-out file, object platforms, and software-defined solutions), while the Company&#8217;s server portfolio includes high-performance rack, blade, tower, and hyperscale servers. The ISG networking portfolio helps business customers transform and modernize their infrastructure, mobilize and enrich end-user experiences, and accelerate business applications and processes. ISG also offers attached software, peripherals, and services, including support and deployment, configuration, and extended warranty services. 

CSG includes sales to commercial and consumer customers of branded hardware (such as desktops, workstations, and notebooks) and branded peripherals (such as displays, docking stations, and other electronics), as well as third-party software and peripherals. CSG also includes services offerings, including support and deployment, configuration, and extended warranty services. 

The reportable segments disclosed herein are based on information reviewed by the Company&#8217;s management to evaluate the business segment results. The Company&#8217;s measure of segment revenue and segment operating income for management reporting purposes excludes operating results of other businesses, unallocated corporate transactions, the impact of purchase accounting, amortization of intangible assets, transaction-related expenses, stock-based compensation expense, and other corporate expenses, as applicable. The Company does not allocate assets to the above reportable segments for internal reporting purposes. 

As described in Note 1 and Note 2 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company completed the VMware Spin-off on November 1, 2021. 

Pursuant to the CFA described in such Notes, Dell Technologies continues to act as a distributor of VMware&#8217;s standalone products and services and purchase such products and services for resale to end-user customers (&#8220;VMware Resale&#8221;). Dell Technologies also continues to integrate VMware&#8217;s products and services with Dell Technologies&#8217; offerings and sell them to end users. The results of such operations are classified as continuing operations within the Company&#8217;s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. The results of standalone VMware Resale transactions are reflected in other businesses. The results of integrated offering transactions are reflected within CSG or ISG, depending upon the nature of the underlying offering sold. The Company's prior period segment results have been recast to reflect this change. 

In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, the results of VMware, excluding Dell's resale of VMware offerings, are presented as discontinued operations in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and, as such, have been excluded from both continuing operations and segment results for prior periods presented.

NOTE 19 &#8212; SUBSEQUENT EVENTS 

Settlement of Class Action Litigation Related to the Class V Transaction 

Subsequent to October 28, 2022, the plaintiffs and the defendants in the class action litigation related to the Class V transaction described in Note 11 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements agreed to settle the action (the &#8220;settlement&#8221;), subject to approval of the settlement by the Delaware Chancery Court. 

Under the terms of the settlement, the plaintiffs have agreed to dismissal of all claims upon payment of a total of $ 1.0 billion (the &#8220;settlement amount&#8221;), which amount will include all costs, expenses and fees of the plaintiff class relating to the action and its resolution. The settlement terms provide that it is a condition of the settlement that the settlement amount will be paid by the Company and/or the Company&#8217;s insurers on behalf of the defendants pursuant to indemnification obligations of the Company to the defendants. 

The settlement is further conditioned on the execution of a definitive settlement agreement containing the foregoing terms and customary terms for class action settlements, and final approval of the settlement by the court. 

If the court does not grant final approval of the settlement and all of its material terms, or the settlement does not otherwise become final or effective, proceedings in the action will continue. 

The settlement agreement provided additional information surrounding conditions that existed as of October 28, 2022 and, as such, was treated as a recognized subsequent event. The Company accrues a liability when it believes that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and that it can reasonably estimate the amount of the loss. Accordingly, the Company established a $ 1.0 billion liability on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as of October 28, 2022 and recognized $ 1.0 billion expense within interest and other, net within the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income for the three months ended October 28, 2022. 

Other than the matter identified above, there were no known events occurring after October 28, 2022 and up until the date of issuance of this report that would materially affect the information presented herein.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

(Unaudited) 

Note 1. Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

Nature of Operations 

Google was incorporated in California in September 1998 and re-incorporated in the State of Delaware in August 2003. In 2015, we implemented a holding company reorganization, and as a result, Alphabet became the successor issuer to Google. 

We generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising, cloud-based solutions that provide customers with platforms, collaboration tools and services, and sales of other products and services, such as apps and in-app purchases, digital content and subscriptions for digital content, and hardware. 

Basis of Consolidation 

The consolidated financial statements of Alphabet include the accounts of Alphabet and entities consolidated under the variable interest and voting models. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. 

Unaudited Interim Financial Information 

The Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2021, the Consolidated Statements of Income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2021, the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2021, the Consolidated Statements of Stockholders' Equity for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2021 and the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2021 are unaudited. These unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (""GAAP""). In our opinion, the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements include all adjustments of a normal recurring nature necessary for the fair presentation of our financial position as of September 30, 2021, our results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2021, and our cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2021. The results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the year ending December 31, 2021. 

These unaudited interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 filed with the SEC. 

Use of Estimates 

Preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to the allowance for credit losses, fair values of financial instruments, intangible assets and goodwill, useful lives of intangible assets and property and equipment, income taxes, and contingent liabilities, among others. We base our estimates on assumptions, both historical and forward looking, that are believed to be reasonable, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. 

The allowance for credit losses on accounts receivable was $ 789 million and $ 567 million as of December 31, 2020 and September 30, 2021, respectively. 

Change in Accounting Estimate 

In January 2021, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our servers and network equipment and adjusted the estimated useful life of our servers from three years to four years and the estimated useful life of certain network equipment from three years to five years . This change in accounting estimate was effective beginning in fiscal year 2021. Based on the carrying value of servers and certain network equipment as of December 31, 2020, and those acquired during the nine months ended September 30, 2021, the effect of this change in estimate was a reduction in depreciation expense of $ 591 million and $ 2.1 billion and an increase in net income of $ 460 million and $ 1.7 billion, or $ 0.69 and $ 2.50 per basic share and $ 0.68 and $ 2.46 per diluted share, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, respectively.

Deferred Revenues and Remaining Performance Obligations 

We record deferred revenues when cash payments are received or due in advance of our performance, including amounts which are refundable. Deferred revenues primarily relate to Google Cloud and Google other. Our total deferred revenue was $ 3.0 billion and $ 3.5 billion as of December 31, 2020 and September 30, 2021, respectively. Of the total deferred revenue as of December 31, 2020, $ 2.1 billion was recognized as revenues during the nine months ended September 30, 2021. 

Additionally, we have performance obligations associated with commitments in customer contracts, primarily related to Google Cloud, for future services that have not yet been recognized as revenues, also referred to as remaining performance obligations. Remaining performance obligations include related deferred revenue currently recorded as well as amounts that will be invoiced in future periods, and excludes (i) contracts with an original expected term of one year or less, (ii) cancellable contracts, and (iii) contracts for which we recognize revenue at the amount to which we have the right to invoice for services performed. As of September 30, 2021, the amount not yet recognized as revenues from these commitments was $ 37.1 billion. We expect to recognize approximately half over the next 24 months with the remaining thereafter. However, the amount and timing of revenue recognition is largely driven by when the customer utilizes the services and our ability to deliver in accordance with relevant contract terms, which could affect our estimate of the remaining performance obligations and when we expect to recognize such as revenues.

Note 3. Financial Instruments 

Debt Securities 

We classify our marketable debt securities, which are accounted for as available-for-sale, within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy because we use quoted market prices to the extent available or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing market observable inputs to determine fair value. 

For certain marketable debt securities, we have elected the fair value option for which changes in fair value are recorded in other income (expense), net. The fair value option was elected for these securities to align with the unrealized gains and losses from related derivative contracts. Unrealized net gains related to debt securities still held where we have elected the fair value option were $ 87 million and $ 22 million as of December 31, 2020 and September 30, 2021, respectively. As of December 31, 2020 and September 30, 2021, the fair value of these debt securities was $ 2.0 billion and $ 3.0 billion, respectively. 

The following tables summarize our debt securities, for which we did not elect the fair value option, by significant investment categories (in millions): &#160; As of December 31, 2020 &#160; Adjusted Cost Gross Unrealized Gains Gross Unrealized Losses Fair Value Cash and Cash Equivalents Marketable Securities Level 2:

We determine realized gains or losses on the sale or extinguishment of debt securities on a specific identification method. We recognized gross realized gains of $ 127 million and $ 109 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 and 2021, respectively, and $ 690 million and $ 360 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2021, respectively. We recognized gross realized losses of $ 8 million and $ 29 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 and 2021, respectively, and $ 135 million and $ 180 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2021, respectively. We reflect these gains and losses as a component of other income (expense), net.

Equity Investments 

The following discusses our marketable equity securities, non-marketable equity securities, gains and losses on marketable and non-marketable equity securities, as well as our equity securities accounted for under the equity method. 

Our marketable equity securities are publicly traded stocks or funds measured at fair value and classified within Level 1 and 2 in the fair value hierarchy because we use quoted prices for identical assets in active markets or inputs that are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets. 

Our non-marketable equity securities are investments in privately held companies without readily determinable market values. The carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities is adjusted to fair value upon observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment (referred to as the measurement alternative). Non-marketable equity securities that have been remeasured during the period based on observable transactions are classified within Level 2 or Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy because we estimate the value based on valuation methods which may include a combination of the observable transaction price at the transaction date and other unobservable inputs including volatility, rights, and obligations of the securities we hold. The fair value of non-marketable equity securities that have been remeasured due to impairment are classified within Level 3.

Gains and losses on marketable and non-marketable equity securities 

Gains and losses reflected in other income (expense), net, for our marketable and non-marketable equity securities are summarized below (in millions): Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30, 2020 2021 2020 2021 Net gain (loss) on equity securities sold during the period $ ( 5 ) $ ( 36 ) $ 426 &#160; $ 545 &#160; Net unrealized gain (loss) on equity securities held as of the end of the period 1,904 &#160; 2,157 &#160; 2,114 &#160; 9,185 &#160; Total gain (loss) recognized in other income (expense), net $ 1,899 &#160; $ 2,121 &#160; $ 2,540 &#160; $ 9,730 &#160; 

In the table above, net gain (loss) on equity securities sold during the period reflects the difference between the sale proceeds and the carrying value of the equity securities at the beginning of the period or the purchase date, if later. 

Cumulative net gains (losses) on equity securities sold during the period, which is summarized in the following table (in millions), represents the total net gains (losses) recognized after the initial purchase date of the equity security. While these net gains may have been reflected in periods prior to the period of sale, we believe they are important supplemental information as they reflect the economic realized net gains on the securities sold during the period. Cumulative net gains are calculated as the difference between the sale price and the initial purchase price for the equity security sold during the period.

The following is a summary of unrealized gains and losses recorded in other income (expense), net, and included as adjustments to the carrying value of non-marketable equity securities (in millions): Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30, 2020 2021 2020 2021 Unrealized gains $ 1,225 &#160; $ 1,260 &#160; $ 1,770 &#160; $ 6,245 &#160; Unrealized losses (including impairment) ( 27 ) ( 37 ) ( 1,413 ) ( 98 ) Total unrealized gain (loss) for non-marketable equity securities $ 1,198 &#160; $ 1,223 &#160; $ 357 &#160; $ 6,147 &#160; 

During the three months ended September 30, 2021, included in the $ 24.1 billion of non-marketable equity securities, $ 2.5 billion were measured at fair value resulting in a net unrealized gain of $ 1.2 billion. 

Equity securities accounted for under the Equity Method 

As of December 31, 2020 and September 30, 2021, equity securities accounted for under the equity method had a carrying value of approximately $ 1.4 billion and $ 1.5 billion, respectively. Our share of gains and losses including impairment are included as a component of other income (expense), net, in the Consolidated Statements of Income. See Note 6 for further details on other income (expense), net. 

Derivative Financial Instruments 

We enter into derivative instruments to manage risks relating to our ongoing business operations. The primary risk managed with derivative instruments is foreign exchange risk. We use foreign currency contracts to reduce the risk that our cash flows, earnings, and investment in foreign subsidiaries will be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We also enter into derivative instruments to partially offset our exposure to other risks and enhance investment returns. 

We recognize derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value and classify the derivatives primarily within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. We present our collar contracts (an option strategy comprised of a combination of purchased and written options) at net fair values where both the purchased and written options are with the same counterparty. For other derivative contracts, we present at gross fair values. We primarily record changes in the fair value in the Consolidated Statements of Income as either other income (expense), net, or revenues, or in the Consolidated Balance Sheets in AOCI, as discussed below. 

We enter into master netting arrangements, which reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. Further, we enter into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or pledged when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from 

Alphabet Inc. 

contractually established thresholds. Cash collateral received related to derivative instruments under our collateral security arrangements are included in other current assets with a corresponding liability. Cash and non-cash collateral pledged related to derivative instruments under our collateral security arrangements are included in other current assets. 

Cash Flow Hedges 

We designate foreign currency forward and option contracts (including collars) as cash flow hedges to hedge certain f orecasted revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. These contracts have maturities of 24 months or less. 

Cash flow hedge amounts included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are deferred in AOCI and subsequently reclassified to revenue when the hedged item is recognized in earnings. We exclude the change in forward points and time value from our assessment of hedge effectiveness. The initial value of the excluded component is amortized on a straight-line basis over the life of the hedging instrument and recognized in revenues. The difference between fair value changes of the excluded component and the amount amortized to revenues is recorded in AOCI. If the hedged transactions become probable of not occurring, the corresponding amounts in AOCI are reclassified to other income (expense), net in the period of de-designation. 

As of September 30, 2021, the net accumulated gain on our foreign currency cash flow hedges before tax effect was $ 357 million, which is expected to be reclassified from AOCI into earnings within the next 12 months. 

Fair Value Hedges 

We designate foreign currency forward contracts as fair value hedges to hedge foreign currency risks for our investments denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Fair value hedge amounts included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in other income (expense), net, along with the offsetting gains and losses of the related hedged items. We exclude changes in forward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize changes in the excluded component in other income (expense), net. 

Net Investment Hedges 

We designate foreign currency forward contracts as net investment hedges to hedge the foreign currency risks related to our investment in foreign subsidiaries. Net investment hedge amounts included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in AOCI along with the foreign currency translation adjustment. We exclude changes in forward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize changes in the excluded component in other income (expense), net. 

Other Derivatives 

Other derivatives not designated as hedging instruments consist primarily of foreign currency forward contracts that we use to hedge intercompany transactions and other monetary assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of a subsidiary. Gains and losses on these contracts, as well as the related costs, are recognized in other income (expense), net, along with the foreign currency gains and losses on monetary assets and liabilities. 

We also use derivatives not designated as hedging instruments to manage risks relating to interest rates, commodity prices, credit exposures and to enhance investment returns. Additionally, from time to time, we enter into derivatives to hedge the market price risk on certain of our marketable equity securities. Gains (losses) arising from these derivatives are reflected within the ""other"" component of other income (expense), net and the offsetting recognized gains (losses) on the marketable equity securities are reflected within the gain (loss) on equity securities, net component of other income (expense), net. See Note 6 for further details on other income (expense), net.

Note 4. Variable Interest Entities 

Consolidated VIEs 

We consolidate VIEs in which we hold a variable interest and are the primary beneficiary. The results of operations and financial position of these VIEs are included in our consolidated financial statements. 

For certain consolidated VIEs, their assets are not available to us and their creditors do not have recourse to us. As of December 31, 2020 and September 30, 2021, assets that can only be used to settle obligations of these VIEs were $ 5.7 billion and $ 6.8 billion, respectively, and the liabilities for which creditors only have recourse to the VIEs were $ 2.3 billion and $ 2.5 billion, respectively. 

Total noncontrolling interests (""NCI""), including redeemable noncontrolling interests (""RNCI""), in our consolidated subsidiaries was $ 3.9 billion and $ 4.4 billion as of December 31, 2020 and September 30, 2021, 

Alphabet Inc. 

respectively. NCI and RNCI are included within additional paid-in capital. Net loss attributable to noncontrolling intere sts was not material for an y period presented and is included within the ""other"" component of other income (expense), net. See Note 6 for further details on other income (expense), net. 

Waymo 

In June 2021, Waymo, a consolidated VIE, completed an investment round with additional funding of $ 2.5 billion, the majority of which represented investment from Alphabet. The investments from external parties were accounted for as equity transactions and resulted in recognition of noncontrolling interests. Waymo is a self-driving technology development company with a mission to make it safe and easy for people and things to get where they're going. 

Unconsolidated VIEs 

We have investments in some VIEs in which we are not the primary beneficiary. These VIEs include private companies that are primarily early stage companies and certain renewable energy entities in which activities involve power generation using renewable sources. 

We have determined that the governance structures of these entities do not allow us to direct the activities that would significantly affect their economic performance. Therefore, we are not the primary beneficiary, and the results of operations and financial position of these VIEs are not included in our consolidated financial statements. We account for these investments as non-marketable equity investments or equity method investments. 

VIEs are generally based on the current carrying value of the investments and any future funding commitments. We have determined that the single source of our exposure to these VIEs is our capital investments in them. The carrying value and maximum exposure of these unconsolidated VIEs were not material as of December 31, 2020 and September 30, 2021. 

Note 5. Debt 

Short-Term Debt 

We have a debt financing program of up to &#160;$ 10.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper, which increased from $ 5.0 billion in September 2021. Net proceeds from this program are used for general corporate purposes. We had no commercial paper outstanding as of December 31, 2020 and September 30, 2021. 

Our short-term debt balance also includes the current portion of certain long-term debt. 

Long-Term Debt

(2) Total current portion of long-term debt is included within other accrued expenses and current liabilities. See Note 6. 

The notes in the table above are comprised of fixed-rate senior unsecured obligations and generally rank equally with each other. We may redeem the notes at any time in whole or in part at specified redemption prices. The effective interest rates are based on proceeds received with interest payable semi-annually. 

The total estimated fair value of the outstanding notes, including the current portion, was approximately $ 14.0 billion and $ 12.3 billion as of December 31, 2020 and September 30, 2021, respectively. The fair value was 

Alphabet Inc. 

determined based on observable market prices of identical instruments in less active markets and is categorized accordingly as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. 

Credit Facility 

As of September 30, 2021, we have $ 10.0 billion of revolving credit facilities. No amounts were outstanding under the credit facilities as of December 31, 2020 and September 30, 2021. 

In April 2021, we terminated the existing $ 4.0 billion revolving credit facilities, which were scheduled to expire in July 2023, and entered into two new revolving credit facilities in the amounts of $ 4.0 billion and $ 6.0 billion, which will expire in April 2022 and April 2026, respectively. The interest rates for the new credit facilities are determined based on a formula using certain market rates, as well as our progress toward the achievement of certain sustainability goals. No amounts have been borrowed under the new credit facilities.

Note 7. Acquisitions 

Fitbit 

In January 2021, we closed the acquisition of Fitbit, Inc. for $ 2.1 billion. The addition of Fitbit to Google Services is expected to help spur innovation in wearable devices. The assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at fair value. The purchase price excludes post acquisition compensation arrangements. The purchase price was attributed to $ 440 million cash acquired, $ 590 million of intangible assets, $ 1.2 billion of goodwill and $ 92 million of net liabilities assumed. Goodwill was recorded in the Google Services segment and primarily attributable to synergies expected to arise after the acquisition. Goodwill is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.

Note 9. Contingencies 

Indemnifications 

In the normal course of business, including to facilitate transactions in our services and products and corporate activities, we indemnify certain parties, including advertisers, Google Network partners, customers of Google Cloud offerings, lessors, and service providers with respect to certain matters. We have agreed to hold certain parties harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants, or out of intellectual property infringement or other claims made against certain parties. Several of these agreements limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim. In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors, and our bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations to our agents. 

It is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Additionally, we have a limited history of prior indemnification claims and the payments we have made under such agreements have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows, or financial position. However, to the extent that valid indemnification claims arise in the future, future payments by us could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in a particular period. 

As of September 30, 2021, we did not have any material indemnification claims that were probable or reasonably possible. 

Legal Matters 

Antitrust Investigations 

On November 30, 2010, the EC's Directorate General for Competition opened an investigation into various antitrust-related complaints against us. 

On June 27, 2017, the EC announced its decision that certain actions taken by Google regarding its display and ranking of shopping search results and ads infringed European competition law. The EC decision imposed a &#8364; 2.4 billion ($ 2.7 billion as of June 27, 2017) fine. On September 11, 2017, we appealed the EC decision and on September 27, 2017, we implemented product changes to bring shopping ads into compliance with the EC's decision. We recognized a charge of $ 2.7 billion for the fine in the second quarter of 2017. 

Alphabet Inc. 

On July 18, 2018, the EC announced its decision that certain provisions in Google&#8217;s Android-related distribution agreements infringed European competition law. The EC decision imposed a &#8364; 4.3 billion ($ 5.1 billion as of June 30, 2018) fine and directed the termination of the conduct at issue. On October 9, 2018, we appealed the EC decision. On October 29, 2018, we implemented changes to certain of our Android distribution practices. We recognized a charge of $ 5.1 billion for the fine in the second quarter of 2018. 

On March 20, 2019, the EC announced its decision that certain contractual provisions in agreements that Google had with AdSense for Search partners infringed European competition law. The EC decision imposed a fine of &#8364; 1.5 billion ($ 1.7 billion as of March 20, 2019) and directed actions related to AdSense for Search partners' agreements, which we implemented prior to the decision. On June 4, 2019, we appealed the EC decision. We recognized a charge of $ 1.7 billion for the fine in the first quarter of 2019. 

While each EC decision is under appeal, we included the fines in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as we provided bank guarantees (in lieu of a cash payment) for the fines. 

From time to time we are subject to formal and informal inquiries and investigations on competition matters by regulatory authorities in the United States, Europe, and other jurisdictions. In August 2019, we began receiving civil investigative demands from the U.S. Department of Justice (""DOJ"") requesting information and documents relating to our prior antitrust investigations and certain aspects of our business. The DOJ and a number of state Attorneys General filed a lawsuit on October 20, 2020 alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws relating to Search and Search advertising. Separately, on December 16, 2020, a number of state Attorneys General filed an antitrust complaint against Google in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws as well as state deceptive trade laws relating to its advertising technology. On June 22, 2021, the EC opened a formal investigation into Google's advertising technology business practices. On July 7, 2021, a number of state Attorneys General filed an antitrust complaint against us in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, alleging that Google&#8217;s operation of Android and Google Play violated U.S. antitrust laws and state antitrust and consumer protection laws. We believe these complaints are without merit and will defend ourselves vigorously. The DOJ and state Attorneys General continue their investigations into certain aspects of our business. We continue to cooperate with federal and state regulators in the United States, the EC, and other regulators around the world. 

Patent and Intellectual Property Claims 

We have had patent, copyright, trade secret, and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us claiming that certain of our products, services, and technologies infringe others' intellectual property rights. Adverse results in these lawsuits may include awards of substantial monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing agreements, or orders preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services. As a result, we may have to change our business practices, and develop non-infringing products or technologies, which could result in a loss of revenues for us and otherwise harm our business. In addition, the U.S. International Trade Commission (""ITC"") has increasingly become an important forum to litigate intellectual property disputes because an ultimate loss in an ITC action can result in a prohibition on importing infringing products into the U.S. Because the U.S. is an important market, a prohibition on importation could have an adverse effect on us, including preventing us from importing many important products into the U.S. or necessitating workarounds that may limit certain features of our products. 

Furthermore, many of our agreements with our customers and partners require us to indemnify them against certain intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase our costs as a result of defending such claims, and may require that we pay significant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims. In addition, our customers and partners may discontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a result of injunctions or otherwise, which could result in loss of revenues and adversely affect our business. 

In 2010, Oracle America, Inc. (""Oracle"") brought a copyright lawsuit against Google in the Northern District of California, alleging that Google's Android operating system infringes Oracle's copyrights related to certain Java application programming interfaces (&#8220;Java APIs&#8221;). After trial, final judgment was entered by the district court in favor of Google on June 8, 2016, and the court decided post-trial motions in favor of Google. Oracle appealed and on March 27, 2018, the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals reversed and remanded the case for a trial on damages. On May 29, 2018, we filed a petition for a rehearing at the Federal Circuit, and on August 28, 2018, the Federal Circuit denied the petition. On January 24, 2019, we filed a petition to the Supreme Court of the United States to review the case. On April 29, 2019, the Supreme Court requested the views of the Solicitor General regarding our petition. On September 27, 2019, the Solicitor General recommended denying our petition, and we provided our response on October 16, 2019. On November 15, 2019, the Supreme Court granted our petition and made a decision to review the case. The Supreme Court heard oral arguments in our case on October 7, 2020. On April 5, 2021, the Supreme Court reversed the Federal Circuit's ruling and found that Google&#8217;s use of the Java APIs was a fair use as a matter 

Alphabet Inc. 

of law. The Supreme Court remanded the case to the Federal Circuit for further proceedings in conformity with the Supreme Court opinion. On May 14, 2021, the Federal Circuit entered an order affirming the district court&#8217;s final judgment in favor of Google. On June 21, 2021, the Federal Circuit issued a mandate returning the case to the district court, and the case is now concluded. 

Other 

We are also regularly subject to claims, suits, regulatory and government investigations, other proceedings, and consent decrees involving competition, intellectual property, privacy, tax and related compliance, labor and employment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using our platforms, personal injury, consumer protection, and other matters. Such claims, suits, regulatory and government investigations, other proceedings, and consent decrees could result in substantial fines and penalties, injunctive relief, ongoing auditing and monitoring obligations, changes to our products and services, alterations to our business models and operations, and collateral related civil litigation or other adverse consequences, all of which could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results. 

Certain of these outstanding matters include speculative, substantial or indeterminate monetary amounts. We record a liability when we believe that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the reasonably possible loss. We evaluate developments in our legal matters that could affect the amount of liability that has been previously accrued, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed, and make adjustments as appropriate. Significant judgment is required to determine both likelihood of there being and the estimated amount of a loss related to such matters. 

With respect to our outstanding matters, based on our current knowledge, we believe that the amount or range of reasonably possible loss will not, either individually or in aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. However, the outcome of such matters is inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties. 

We expense legal fees in the period in which they are incurred. 

Non-Income Taxes 

We are under audit by various domestic and foreign tax authorities with regards to non-income tax matters. The subject matter of non-income tax audits primarily arises from disputes on the tax treatment and tax rate applied to the sale of our products and services in these jurisdictions and the tax treatment of certain employee benefits. We accrue non-income taxes that may result from examinations by, or any negotiated agreements with, these tax authorities when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the reasonably possible loss. Due to the inherent complexity and uncertainty of these matters and judicial process in certain jurisdictions, the final outcome may be materially different from our expectations. 

For information regarding income tax contingencies, see Note 13. 

Note 10. Stockholders' Equity 

Share Repurchases 

In April 2021, the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to $ 50.0 billion of its Class C stock. In July 2021, the Alphabet board approved an amendment to the April 2021 authorization, permitting the company to repurchase both Class A and Class C shares in a manner deemed in the best interest of the company and its stockholders, taking into account the economic cost and prevailing market conditions, including the relative trading prices and volumes of the Class A and Class C shares. As of September 30, 2021, $ 30.8 billion remains available for repurchase of Class A and Class C shares under the amended authorization. The repurchases are being executed from time to time, subject to general business and market conditions and other investment opportunities, through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including through Rule 10b5-1 plans. The repurchase program does not have an expiration date. 

In accordance with the authorization of the Board of Directors of Alphabet, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, we repurchased and subsequently retired 4.6 million and 15.7 million aggregate shares for $ 12.6 billion and $ 36.8 billion, respectively. Of the aggregate amount repurchased and subsequently retired during the three months ended September 30, 2021, 0.5 million shares were Class A stock for $ 1.5 billion.

Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30, 2020 2021 2020 2021 Provision for income taxes $ 2,112 &#160; $ 4,128 &#160; $ 4,351 &#160; $ 10,941 &#160; Effective tax rate 15.8 &#160; % 17.9 &#160; % 14.8 &#160; % 16.5 &#160; % 

We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. Our total gross unrecognized tax benefits were $ 3.8 billion and $ 5.3 billion as of December 31, 2020 and September 30, 2021, respectively. Our total unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate were $ 2.6 billion and $ 3.7 billion as of December 31, 2020 and September 30, 2021, respectively. Although the timing of the resolution, settlement, and closure of audits is not certain, we do not believe it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits will materially change in the next 12 months. 

For information regarding non-income taxes, see Note 9. 

Note 14. Information about Segments and Geographic Areas 

Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2020, we report our segment results as Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets: 

&#8226; Google Services includes products and services such as ads, Android, Chrome, hardware, Google Maps, Google Play, Search, and YouTube. Google Services generates revenues primarily from advertising; sales of apps, in-app purchases, digital content products, and hardware; and fees received for subscription-based products such as YouTube Premium and YouTube TV. 

&#8226; Google Cloud includes Google&#8217;s infrastructure and data analytics platforms, collaboration tools, and other services for enterprise customers. Google Cloud generates revenues primarily from fees received for Google Cloud Platform services and Google Workspace collaboration tools. 

&#8226; Other Bets is a combination of multiple operating segments that are not individually material. Revenues from the Other Bets are derived primarily through the sale of internet services as well as licensing and R&#38;D services. 

Revenues and certain costs, such as costs associated with content and traffic acquisition, certain engineering, and hardware costs and other operating expenses, are directly attributable to our segments. Due to the integrated nature of Alphabet, other costs and expenses, such as technical infrastructure and office facilities, are managed centrally at a consolidated level. The associated costs, including depreciation and impairment, are allocated to operating segments as a service cost generally based on usage or headcount. 

Unallocated corporate costs primarily include corporate initiatives, corporate shared costs, such as finance and legal, including certain fines and settlements, as well as costs associated with certain shared research and development activities. Additionally, hedging gains (losses) related to revenue are included in corporate costs. 

Our Chief Operating Decision Maker does not evaluate operating segments using asset information. 

Information about segments during the periods presented were as follows (in millions). For comparative purposes, amounts in prior periods have been recast: &#160; Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30, &#160; 2020 2021 2020 2021 Revenues: Google Services $ 42,573 &#160; $ 59,884 &#160; $ 115,762 &#160; $ 168,129 &#160; Google Cloud 3,444 &#160; 4,990 &#160; 9,228 &#160; 13,665 &#160; Other Bets 178 &#160; 182 &#160; 461 &#160; 572 &#160; Hedging gains (losses) ( 22 ) 62 &#160; 178 &#160; ( 54 ) Total revenues $ 46,173 &#160; $ 65,118 &#160; $ 125,629 &#160; $ 182,312 &#160;

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

1. Basis of Presentation: 

The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and footnotes of the International Business Machines Corporation (IBM or the company) have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). The financial statements and footnotes are unaudited. In the opinion of the company&#8217;s management, these statements include all adjustments, which are only of a normal recurring nature, necessary to present a fair statement of the company&#8217;s results of operations, financial position and cash flows.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amount of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs, expenses and other comprehensive income/(loss) that are reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying disclosures. These estimates are based on management&#8217;s best knowledge of current events, historical experience, actions that the company may undertake in the future and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. As a result, actual results may be different from these estimates.

In the fourth quarter of 2022, the company completed its annual assessment of the useful lives of its property, plant and equipment. Due to advances in technology, the company determined it should increase the estimated useful lives of its server and network equipment from five to six years for new assets and from three to four years for used assets. This change in accounting estimate was effective beginning January 1, 2023. Based on the carrying amount of server and network equipment included in property, plant and equipment-net in the company&#8217;s Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2022, the effect of this change in estimate was an increase in income from continuing operations before income taxes of $ 74 million or $ 0.06 per both basic and diluted share for the three months ended March 31, 2023.

&#8203; 

For the three months ended March 31, 2023, the company recorded a provision for income taxes of $ 124 million and its effective tax rate was 11.7 percent. For the three months ended March 31, 2022, the company recorded a benefit from income taxes of $ 39 million and its effective tax rate was ( 6.3 ) percent. The rates are driven by many factors including the geographical mix of income, incentives, and changes in unrecognized tax benefits. The prior-year rate also reflects the impact of updates to the foreign tax credit regulations.

&#8203; 

Noncontrolling interest amounts of $ 4.6 million and $ 4.9 million, net of tax, for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, are included as a reduction within other (income) and expense in the Consolidated Income Statement.

The company has supplier finance programs with third-party financial institutions where the company agrees to pay the financial institutions the stated amounts of invoices from participating suppliers on the originally invoiced maturity date, which have an average term of 90 days . The financial institutions offer earlier payment of the invoices at the sole discretion of the supplier for a discounted amount. The company does not provide secured legal assets or other forms of guarantees under the arrangements. The company is not a party to the arrangement between its suppliers and the financial institutions. These obligations are recognized as accounts payable in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The obligations outstanding under these programs at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 were $ 113 million and $ 60 million, respectively.

Interim results are not necessarily indicative of financial results for a full year. The information included in this Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the company&#8217;s 2022 Annual Report.

Within the financial statements and tables presented, certain columns and rows may not add due to the use of rounded numbers for disclosure purposes. Percentages presented are calculated from the underlying whole-dollar amounts. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. This is annotated where applicable.

2. Accounting Changes: 

Standards Implemented 

&#8203; 

Disclosures of Supplier Finance Program Obligations 

Standard/Description&#8211; Issuance date: September 2022. This guidance requires an entity to provide certain interim and annual disclosures about the use of supplier finance programs in connection with the purchase of goods or services.

Effective Date and Adoption Considerations&#8211; The guidance was effective January 1, 2023 with certain annual disclosures required beginning in 2024 and early adoption was permitted. The company adopted the guidance as of the effective date.

Effect on Financial Statements or Other Significant Matters&#8211; The guidance did not have a material impact in the consolidated financial results. Refer to note 1, &#8220;Basis of Presentation,&#8221; for additional information.

Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures 

Standard/Description &#8211;Issuance date: March 2022. This eliminates the accounting guidance for troubled debt restructurings and requires an entity to apply the general loan modification guidance to all loan modifications, including those made to customers experiencing financial difficulty, to determine whether the modification results in a new loan or a continuation of an existing loan. The guidance also requires presenting current period gross write-offs by year of origination for financing receivables and net investment in leases.

Effective Date and Adoption Considerations &#8211;The amendment was effective January 1, 2023 and early adoption was permitted. The company adopted the guidance on a prospective basis as of the effective date.

Effect on Financial Statements or Other Significant Matters &#8211;The guidance did not have a material impact in the consolidated financial results. Refer to note 9, &#8220;Financing Receivables,&#8221; for additional information.

Remaining Performance Obligations 

The remaining performance obligation (RPO) disclosure provides the aggregate amount of the transaction price yet to be recognized as of the end of the reporting period and an explanation as to when the company expects to recognize these amounts in revenue. It is intended to be a statement of overall work under contract that has not yet been performed and does not include contracts in which the customer is not committed, such as certain as-a-Service, governmental, term software license and services offerings. The customer is not considered committed when they are able to terminate for convenience without payment of a substantive penalty. The disclosure includes estimates of variable consideration, except when the variable consideration is a sales-based or usage-based royalty promised in exchange for a license of intellectual property. Additionally, as a practical expedient, the company does not include contracts that have an original duration of one year or less. RPO estimates are subject to change and are affected by several factors, including terminations, changes in the scope of contracts, periodic revalidations, adjustment for revenue that has not materialized and adjustments for currency. 

At March 31, 2023, the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to RPO related to customer contracts that are unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied was $ 58 billion. Approximately 71 percent of the amount is expected to be recognized as revenue in the subsequent two years , approximately 27 percent in the subsequent three to five years and the balance thereafter.

Revenue Recognized for Performance Obligations Satisfied (or Partially Satisfied) in Prior Periods 

For the three months ended March 31, 2023, revenue was reduced by $ 47 million for performance obligations satisfied (or partially satisfied) in previous periods mainly due to changes in estimates on contracts with cost-to-cost measures of progress.

5. Acquisitions &#38; Divestitures: 

Acquisitions 

Purchase price consideration for all acquisitions was paid primarily in cash. All acquisitions, except otherwise stated, were for 100 percent of the acquired business and are reported in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, net of acquired cash and cash equivalents.

During the three months ended March 31, 2023, the company completed three acquisitions at an aggregate cost of $ 226 million. Each acquisition is expected to enhance the company&#8217;s portfolio of products and services capabilities and further advance IBM&#8217;s hybrid cloud and AI strategy.

Of the amount outstanding, $ 173 million was recorded as restricted cash in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and is expected to be paid in 2023 with the remaining $ 14 million expected to be paid in the first quarter of 2024. The unremitted cash associated with these acquisitions is a non-cash investing activity for purposes of the company&#8217;s Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows as of March 31, 2023.

&#8203; 

The following table reflects the purchase price related to these acquisitions and the resulting purchase price allocation as of March 31, 2023.

The goodwill generated was assigned to the Software segment and is primarily attributable to the assembled workforce of the acquired businesses and the increased synergies expected to be achieved from the integration of the 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements &#8212; (continued) 

acquired businesses into the company&#8217;s various integrated solutions and services, neither of which qualifies as an amortizable intangible asset. It is expected that none of the goodwill will be deductible for tax purposes.

The overall weighted-average useful life of the identified amortizable intangible assets acquired was 6.6 years. The identified intangible assets will be amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives, which approximates the pattern that the assets&#8217; economic benefits are expected to be consumed over time.

The valuation of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is subject to revision. If additional information becomes available, the company may further revise the purchase price allocation as soon as practical, but no later than one year from the acquisition date; however, material changes are not expected.

&#8203; 

In April 2023, the company acquired Ahana Cloud, Inc. (Ahana), an expert in open-source-based, managed cloud-native data analytics solutions. Ahana will be integrated into the Software segment. At the date of issuance of the financial statements, the initial purchase accounting for Ahana was not complete.

&#8203; 

Divestitures 

Separation of Kyndryl &#8212; On November 3, 2021, the company completed the separation of its managed infrastructure services unit into a new public company with the distribution of 80.1 percent of the outstanding common stock of Kyndryl Holdings, Inc. (Kyndryl) to IBM stockholders on a pro rata basis. The company retained 19.9 percent of the shares of Kyndryl common stock immediately following the separation. During 2022, the company fully disposed of its retained interest in Kyndryl common stock pursuant to exchange agreements with a third-party financial institution, which were completed within twelve months of separation. As of November 2, 2022, the company no longer held an ownership interest in Kyndryl.

Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax for the three months ended March 31, 2023 of $ 7 million reflects the net impact of changes in separation-related estimates and the settlement of assets and liabilities in accordance with the separation and distribution agreement. Income from discontinued operations, net of tax for the three months ended March 31, 2022 of $ 71 million reflects the same drivers above and also reflects a gain on sale of a joint venture historically managed by Kyndryl, which transferred to Kyndryl in the first quarter of 2022 upon receiving regulatory approval.

8. Financial Assets &#38; Liabilities : 

Fair Value Measurements 

&#8203; 

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The company classifies certain assets and liabilities based on the following fair value hierarchy:

&#8203; 

&#9679; Level 1&#8212;Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that can be accessed at the measurement date; &#8203; 

&#9679; Level 2&#8212;Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; and &#8203; 

&#9679; Level 3&#8212;Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. &#8203; 

When available, the company uses unadjusted quoted market prices in active markets to measure the fair value and classifies such items as Level 1. If quoted market prices are not available, fair value is based upon internally developed models that use current market-based or independently sourced market parameters such as interest rates and currency rates. Items valued using internally generated models are classified according to the lowest level input or value driver that is significant to the valuation.

&#8203; 

The determination of fair value considers various factors including interest rate yield curves and time value underlying the financial instruments. For derivatives and debt securities, the company uses a discounted cash flow analysis using discount rates commensurate with the duration of the instrument.

&#8203; 

In determining the fair value of financial instruments, the company considers certain market valuation adjustments to the &#8220;base valuations&#8221; calculated using the methodologies described below for several parameters that market participants would consider in determining fair value:

&#8203; 

&#9679; Counterparty credit risk adjustments are applied to financial instruments, taking into account the actual credit risk of a counterparty as observed in the credit default swap market to determine the true fair value of such an instrument. &#8203; 

&#9679; Credit risk adjustments are applied to reflect the company&#8217;s own credit risk when valuing all liabilities measured at fair value. The methodology is consistent with that applied in developing counterparty credit risk adjustments, but incorporates the company&#8217;s own credit risk as observed in the credit default swap market. &#8203; 

The company holds investments primarily in time deposits, certificates of deposit, and U.S. government debt that are designated as available-for-sale. The primary objective of the company&#8217;s cash and debt investment portfolio is to protect principal by investing in very liquid investment securities with highly rated counterparties.

&#8203; 

The company&#8217;s standard practice is to hold all of its debt security investments classified as available-for-sale until maturity. No impairment for credit losses and no material non-credit impairments were recorded for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 

&#8203; 

Certain non-financial assets such as property, plant and equipment, operating right-of-use assets, land, goodwill and intangible assets are also subject to nonrecurring fair value measurements if they are deemed to be impaired. The impairment models used for non-financial assets depend on the type of asset. There were no material impairments of non-financial assets for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

&#8203; 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements &#8212; (continued)

Financial Assets and Liabilities Not Measured at Fair Value 

&#8203; 

Short-Term Receivables and Payables

&#8203; 

Short-term receivables (excluding the current portion of long-term receivables) and other investments are financial assets with carrying values that approximate fair value. Accounts payable, other accrued expenses and short-term debt (excluding the current portion of long-term debt) are financial liabilities with carrying values that approximate fair value. If measured at fair value in the financial statements, these financial instruments would be classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy, except for short-term debt which would be classified as Level 2.

&#8203; 

Loans and Long-Term Receivables

&#8203; 

Fair values are based on discounted future cash flows using current interest rates offered for similar loans to clients with similar credit ratings for the same remaining maturities. At March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the difference between the carrying amount and estimated fair value for loans and long-term receivables was immaterial. If measured at fair value in the financial statements, these financial instruments would be classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements &#8212; (continued) 

Long-Term Debt

&#8203; 

Fair value of publicly traded long-term debt is based on quoted market prices for the identical liability when traded as an asset in an active market. For other long-term debt (including long-term finance lease liabilities) for which a quoted market price is not available, an expected present value technique that uses rates currently available to the company for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities is used to estimate fair value. The carrying amount of long-term debt was $ 53,826 million and $ 46,189 million, and the estimated fair value was $ 50,811 million and $ 42,514 million at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. If measured at fair value in the financial statements, long-term debt (including the current portion) would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. 

9. Financing Receivables: 

Financing receivables primarily consist of client loan and installment payment receivables (loans), investment in sales-type and direct financing leases (collectively referred to as client financing receivables) and commercial financing receivables. Loans are provided primarily to clients to finance the purchase of hardware, software and services. Payment terms on these financing arrangements are for terms up to seven years . Investment in sales-type and direct financing leases relate principally to the company&#8217;s Infrastructure products and are for terms ranging generally from two to six years . Commercial financing receivables, which consist of both held-for-investment and held-for-sale receivables, relate primarily to working capital financing for dealers and remarketers of IBM products. Payment terms for working capital financing generally range from 30 to 90 days .

A summary of the components of the company&#8217;s financing receivables is presented as follows:

* The carrying value of the receivables classified as held for sale approximates fair value.

The company has a long-standing practice of taking mitigation actions, in certain circumstances, to transfer credit risk to third parties. These actions may include credit insurance, financial guarantees, nonrecourse secured borrowings, transfers of receivables recorded as true sales in accordance with accounting guidance or sales of equipment under operating lease. Sale of receivables arrangements are also utilized in the normal course of business as part of the company&#8217;s cash and liquidity management.

&#8203; 

Financing receivables pledged as collateral for secured borrowings were $ 283 million and $ 349 million at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. These borrowings are included in note 12, &#8220;Borrowings.&#8221;

Transfer of Financial Assets 

The company has an existing agreement with a third-party investor to sell IBM short-term commercial financing receivables on a revolving basis. In addition, the company enters into agreements with third-party financial institutions to sell certain of its client financing receivables, including both loan and lease receivables, for cash proceeds. There were no material client financing receivables transferred for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022.

The following table presents the total amount of commercial financing receivables transferred.

Of the total amount of commercial financing receivables sold and derecognized from the Consolidated Balance Sheet, the amounts presented remained uncollected from the business partners as of March 31, 2023 and 2022. 

The transfer of these receivables qualified as true sales and therefore reduced financing receivables. The cash proceeds from the sales are included in cash flows from operating activities. The impacts to the Consolidated Income Statement, including fees and net loss associated with the transfer of commercial financing receivables for the three months ending March 31, 2023 and 2022 were $ 24 million and $ 11 million, respectively.

Financing Receivables by Portfolio Segment 

The following tables present the amortized cost basis for client financing receivables at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, further segmented by three classes: Americas, Europe/Middle East/Africa (EMEA) and Asia Pacific. The commercial financing receivables portfolio segment is excluded from the tables in the sections below as the receivables are short term in nature and the current estimated risk of loss and resulting impact to the company&#8217;s financial results are not material.

* At a contract level, which includes total billed and unbilled amounts for financing receivables aged greater than 90 days.

** Of the amortized cost not accruing, there was a related allowance of $ 121 million and $ 122 million at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. Financing income recognized on these receivables was immaterial for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

&#8203; 

Credit Quality Indicators 

The company&#8217;s credit quality indicators, which are based on rating agency data, publicly available information and information provided by customers, are reviewed periodically based on the relative level of risk. The resulting indicators are a numerical rating system that maps to Moody&#8217;s Investors Service credit ratings as shown below. The company uses information provided by Moody&#8217;s, where available, as one of many inputs in its determination of customer credit ratings. The credit quality of the customer is evaluated based on these indicators and is assigned the same risk rating whether the receivable is a lease or a loan.

The following tables present the amortized cost basis for client financing receivables by credit quality indicator at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. Receivables with a credit quality indicator ranging from Aaa to Baa3 are considered investment grade. All others are considered non-investment grade. The credit quality indicators reflect mitigating credit enhancement actions taken by customers which reduce the risk to IBM. Gross write-offs by vintage year at March 31, 2023 were not material.

* Amounts as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 include an increase in net intangible asset balances of $ 30 million and a decrease of $ 198 million, respectively, due to foreign currency translation. 

** 

Other intangibles are primarily acquired proprietary and non-proprietary business processes, methodologies and systems . 

&#8203; 

The net carrying amount of intangible assets decreased $ 279 million during the first three months of 2023, primarily due to intangible asset amortization, partially offset by additions of capitalized software and acquired intangibles. The aggregate intangible amortization expense was $ 547 million and $ 625 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. In the first three months of 2023, the company retired $ 992 million of fully amortized intangible assets, impacting both the gross carrying amount and accumulated amortization by this amount.

The future amortization expense relating to intangible assets currently recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheet is estimated to be the following at March 31, 2023:

There were no goodwill impairment losses recorded during the first three months of 2023 or full-year 2022 and the company has no accumulated impairment losses. Purchase price adjustments recorded in the first three months of 2023 and full-year 2022 were related to acquisitions that were still subject to the measurement period that ends at the earlier of 12 months from the acquisition date or when information becomes available. Net purchase price adjustments recorded during the first three months of 2023 were not material. Net purchase price adjustments recorded in 2022 primarily related to deferred tax assets and liabilities associated with the Turbonomic acquisition.

* Includes notes, debentures, bank loans and secured borrowings.

** The portion of the company&#8217;s fixed-rate debt obligations that is hedged is reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as an amount equal to the sum of the debt&#8217;s carrying value and a fair value adjustment representing changes in the fair value of the hedged debt obligations attributable to movements in benchmark interest rates.

The company&#8217;s indenture governing its debt securities and its various credit facilities each contain significant covenants which obligate the company to promptly pay principal and interest, limit the aggregate amount of secured indebtedness and sale and leaseback transactions to 10 percent of the company&#8217;s consolidated net tangible assets, and 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements &#8212; (continued) 

restrict the company&#8217;s ability to merge or consolidate unless certain conditions are met. The credit facilities also include a covenant on the company&#8217;s consolidated net interest expense ratio, which cannot be less than 2.20 to 1.0, as well as a cross default provision with respect to other defaulted indebtedness of at least $ 500 million. 

The company is in compliance with its debt covenants and provides periodic certifications to its lenders. The failure to comply with its debt covenants could constitute an event of default with respect to the debt to which such provisions apply. If certain events of default were to occur, the principal and interest on the debt to which such event of default applied would become immediately due and payable. 

In the first quarter of 2023, the company issued $ 0.7 billion of Japanese yen floating-rate syndicated bank loans with a maturity of 5 years ; $ 4.6 billion of Euro fixed-rate notes in tranches with maturities ranging from 4 to 20 years and coupons ranging from 3.375 to 4 percent; $ 0.9 billion of Pound sterling fixed-rate notes with a maturity of 15 years and a coupon of 4.875 percent; and $ 3.25 billion of U.S. dollar fixed-rate notes in tranches with maturities ranging from 3 to 30 years and coupons ranging from 4.5 to 5.1 percent.

The company has a $ 2.5 billion Three-Year Credit Agreement and a $ 7.5 billion Five-Year Credit Agreement with maturity dates of June 20, 2025 and June 22, 2027, respectively. The Credit Agreements permit the company and its subsidiary borrowers to borrow up to $ 10 billion on a revolving basis. At March 31, 2023, there were no borrowings by the company, or its subsidiaries, under these credit facilities.

&#8203; 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements &#8212; (continued) 

13. Commitments: 

The company&#8217;s extended lines of credit to third-party entities include unused amounts of $ 1.4 billion and $ 1.6 billion at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. A portion of these amounts was available to the company&#8217;s business partners to support their working capital needs. In addition, the company has committed to provide future financing to its clients in connection with client purchase agreements for $ 1.7 billion and $ 2.1 billion at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. The reduction in the future financing commitments is primarily due to lower services financing in the current quarter. The company collectively evaluates the allowance for these arrangements using a provision methodology consistent with the portfolio of the commitments. Refer to note A, &#8220;Significant Accounting Policies,&#8221; in the company&#8217;s 2022 Annual Report for additional information. The allowance for these commitments is recorded in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and was not material at March 31, 2023. 

The company has applied the guidance requiring a guarantor to disclose certain types of guarantees, even if the likelihood of requiring the guarantor&#8217;s performance is remote. The following is a description of arrangements in which the company is the guarantor.

The company is a party to a variety of agreements pursuant to which it may be obligated to indemnify the other party with respect to certain matters. Typically, these obligations arise in the context of contracts entered into by the company, under which the company customarily agrees to hold the party harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations and covenants related to such matters as title to the assets sold, certain intellectual property rights, specified environmental matters, third-party performance of nonfinancial contractual obligations and certain income taxes. In each of these circumstances, payment by the company is conditioned on the other party making a claim pursuant to the procedures specified in the particular contract, the procedures of which typically allow the company to challenge the other party&#8217;s claims. While indemnification provisions typically do not include a contractual maximum on the company&#8217;s payment, the company&#8217;s obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of time and/or nature of claim, and in some instances, the company may have recourse against third parties for certain payments made by the company.

It is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under these or similar agreements due to the conditional nature of the company&#8217;s obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Historically, payments made by the company under these agreements have not had a material effect on the company&#8217;s business, financial condition or results of operations. 

In addition, the company guarantees certain loans and financial commitments. The maximum potential future payment under these financial guarantees and the fair value of these guarantees recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 was not material. 

Changes in the company&#8217;s warranty liability for standard warranties, which are included in other accrued expenses and liabilities and other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, and for extended warranty contracts, which are included in deferred income in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, are presented in the following tables.

14. Contingencies: 

As a company with a substantial employee population and with clients in more than 175 countries, IBM is involved, either as plaintiff or defendant, in a variety of ongoing claims, demands, suits, investigations, tax matters and proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of its business. The company is a leader in the information technology industry and, as such, has been and will continue to be subject to claims challenging its IP rights and associated products and offerings, including claims of copyright and patent infringement and violations of trade secrets and other IP rights. In addition, the company enforces its own IP against infringement, through license negotiations, lawsuits or otherwise. Further, given the rapidly evolving external landscape of cybersecurity, privacy and data protection laws, regulations and threat actors, the company and its clients have been and will continue to be subject to actions or proceedings in various jurisdictions. Also, as is typical for companies of IBM&#8217;s scope and scale, the company is party to actions and proceedings in various jurisdictions involving a wide range of labor and employment issues (including matters related to contested employment decisions, country-specific labor and employment laws, and the company&#8217;s pension, retirement and other benefit plans), as well as actions with respect to contracts, product liability, securities, foreign operations, competition law and environmental matters. These actions may be commenced by a number of different parties, including competitors, clients, current or former employees, government and regulatory agencies, stockholders and representatives of the locations in which the company does business. Some of the actions to which the company is party may involve particularly complex technical issues, and some actions may raise novel questions under the laws of the various jurisdictions in which these matters arise.

The company records a provision with respect to a claim, suit, investigation or proceeding when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Any recorded liabilities, including any changes to such liabilities for the quarter ended March 31, 2023 were not material to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

In accordance with the relevant accounting guidance, the company provides disclosures of matters for which the likelihood of material loss is at least reasonably possible. In addition, the company also discloses matters based on its consideration of other matters and qualitative factors, including the experience of other companies in the industry, and investor, customer and employee relations considerations.

With respect to certain of the claims, suits, investigations and proceedings discussed herein, the company believes at this time that the likelihood of any material loss is remote, given, for example, the procedural status, court rulings, and/or the strength of the company&#8217;s defenses in those matters. With respect to the remaining claims, suits, investigations and proceedings discussed in this note, except as specifically discussed herein, the company is unable to provide estimates of reasonably possible losses or range of losses, including losses in excess of amounts accrued, if any, for the following reasons. Claims, suits, investigations and proceedings are inherently uncertain, and it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of these matters. It is the company&#8217;s experience that damage amounts claimed in litigation against it are unreliable and unrelated to possible outcomes, and as such are not meaningful indicators of the company&#8217;s potential liability. Further, the company is unable to provide such an estimate due to a number of other factors with respect to 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements &#8212; (continued) 

these claims, suits, investigations and proceedings, including considerations of the procedural status of the matter in question, the presence of complex or novel legal theories, and/or the ongoing discovery and development of information important to the matters. The company reviews claims, suits, investigations and proceedings at least quarterly, and decisions are made with respect to recording or adjusting provisions and disclosing reasonably possible losses or range of losses (individually or in the aggregate), to reflect the impact and status of settlement discussions, discovery, procedural and substantive rulings, reviews by counsel and other information pertinent to a particular matter.

Whether any losses, damages or remedies finally determined in any claim, suit, investigation or proceeding could reasonably have a material effect on the company&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows will depend on a number of variables, including: the timing and amount of such losses or damages; the structure and type of any such remedies; the significance of the impact any such losses, damages or remedies may have in the Consolidated Financial Statements; and the unique facts and circumstances of the particular matter that may give rise to additional factors. While the company will continue to defend itself vigorously, it is possible that the company&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be affected in any particular period by the resolution of one or more of these matters.

The following is a summary of the more significant legal matters involving the company.

On June 8, 2021, IBM sued GlobalFoundries U.S. Inc. (GF) in New York State Supreme Court for claims including fraud and breach of contract relating to a long-term strategic relationship between IBM and GF for researching, developing, and manufacturing advanced semiconductor chips for IBM. GF walked away from its obligations and IBM is now suing to recover amounts paid to GF, and other compensatory and punitive damages, totaling more than $ 1.5 billion. On September 14, 2021, the court ruled on GF&#8217;s motion to dismiss. On April 7, 2022, the Appellate Division unanimously reversed the lower court&#8217;s dismissal of IBM&#8217;s fraud claim. IBM&#8217;s claims for breaches of contract, promissory estoppel, and fraud are proceeding.

On April 5, 2022, a putative securities law class action was commenced in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging that during the period from April 4, 2017 through October 20, 2021, certain strategic imperatives revenues were misclassified. The company, two current IBM senior executives, and two former IBM senior executives are named as defendants. On June 23, 2022, the court entered an order appointing Iron Workers Local 580 Joint Funds as lead plaintiff. On September 21, 2022, the plaintiff voluntarily dismissed the case, without prejudice. On January 13, 2023, a putative securities law class action making allegations substantially similar to those in the dismissed case was filed in the same court. On April 4, 2023, the court entered an order appointing June E. Adams Irrevocable Trust Dated 7/21/14 FBO Edward Adams, the same entity that filed the since-dismissed April 5, 2022 class action, as lead plaintiff. On March 25, 2022, the Board of Directors received a shareholder demand letter making similar allegations and demanding that the company&#8217;s Board of Directors take action to assert the company&#8217;s rights. A special committee of independent directors was formed to investigate the issues raised in the letter. The special committee has completed its investigation and recommended that no claims should be asserted on behalf of the company. The independent directors of the company&#8217;s Board of Directors unanimously adopted that recommendation.

On June 2, 2022, a putative class action lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging that the IBM Pension Plan miscalculated certain joint and survivor annuity pension benefits by using outdated actuarial tables in violation of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. IBM, the Plan Administrator Committee, and the IBM Pension Plan are named as defendants.

As disclosed in the Kyndryl Form 10 and subsequent Kyndryl public filings, in 2017 BMC Software, Inc. (BMC) filed suit against IBM in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas in a dispute involving IBM&#8217;s former managed infrastructure services business. On May 30, 2022, the trial court awarded BMC $ 718 million in direct damages and $ 718 million in punitive damages, plus interest and fees. IBM filed a notice of appeal. IBM does not believe it has any material exposure relating to this litigation. No material liability or related indemnification asset has been recorded by IBM.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements &#8212; (continued) 

The company is party to, or otherwise involved in, proceedings brought by U.S. federal or state environmental agencies under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), known as &#8220;Superfund,&#8221; or laws similar to CERCLA. Such statutes require potentially responsible parties to participate in remediation activities regardless of fault or ownership of sites. The company is also conducting environmental investigations, assessments or remediations at or in the vicinity of several current or former operating sites globally pursuant to permits, administrative orders or agreements with country, state or local environmental agencies, and is involved in lawsuits and claims concerning certain current or former operating sites.

The company is also subject to ongoing tax examinations and governmental assessments in various jurisdictions. Along with many other U.S. companies doing business in Brazil, the company is involved in various challenges with Brazilian tax authorities regarding non-income tax assessments and non-income tax litigation matters. The total potential amount related to all these matters for all applicable years is approximately $ 400 million. The company believes it will prevail on these matters and that this amount is not a meaningful indicator of liability.

16. Derivative Financial Instruments: 

The company operates in multiple functional currencies and is a significant lender and borrower in the global markets. In the normal course of business, the company is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations, and to a lesser extent equity and commodity price changes and client credit risk. The company limits these risks by following established risk management policies and procedures, including the use of derivatives, and, where cost effective, financing with debt in the currencies in which assets are denominated. For interest rate exposures, derivatives are used to better align rate movements between the interest rates associated with the company&#8217;s lease and other financial assets and the interest rates associated with its financing debt. Derivatives are also used to manage the related cost of debt. For foreign currency exposures, derivatives are used to better manage the cash flow volatility arising from foreign exchange rate fluctuations.

In the Consolidated Balance Sheet, the company does not offset derivative assets against liabilities in master netting arrangements nor does it offset receivables or payables recognized upon payment or receipt of cash collateral against the fair values of the related derivative instruments. At March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the amount recognized in other accounts receivable for the right to reclaim cash collateral was $ 42 million and $ 140 million, respectively. At March 31, 2023, there was no amount recognized in accounts payable for the obligation to return cash collateral. At December 31, 2022, the amount recognized in accounts payable for such obligation was $ 8 million. The company restricts the use of cash collateral received to rehypothecation, and therefore reports it in restricted cash in the Consolidated Balance Sheet . There was no cash collateral rehypothecated at March 31, 2023. At December 31, 2022, the amount rehypothecated was $ 8 million. Additionally, if derivative exposures covered by a qualifying master netting agreement had been netted in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at March 31 , 2023 and December 31 , 2022, the total derivative asset and liability positions each would have been reduced by $ 157 million and $ 220 million, respectively.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements &#8212; (continued) 

In its hedging programs, the company may use forward contracts, futures contracts, interest-rate swaps, cross-currency swaps, equity swaps, and options depending upon the underlying exposure. The company is not a party to leveraged derivative instruments.

A brief description of the major hedging programs, categorized by underlying risk, follows.

Interest Rate Risk 

Fixed and Variable Rate Borrowings 

The company issues debt in the global capital markets to fund its operations and financing business. Access to cost-effective financing can result in interest rate mismatches with the underlying assets. To manage these mismatches and to reduce overall interest cost, the company may use interest-rate swaps to convert specific fixed-rate debt issuances into variable-rate debt (i.e., fair value hedges) and to convert specific variable-rate debt issuances into fixed-rate debt (i.e., cash flow hedges). At March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the total notional amount of the company&#8217;s interest-rate swaps was $ 6.9 billion and $ 6.5 billion, respectively. The weighted-average remaining maturity of these instruments at both March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 was approximately 6 years. These interest-rate contracts were accounted for as fair value hedges. The company did not have any cash flow hedges relating to this program outstanding at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022.

Forecasted Debt Issuance 

The company is exposed to interest rate volatility on future debt issuances. To manage this risk, the company may use instruments such as forward starting interest-rate swaps to lock in the rate on the interest payments related to the forecasted debt issuances. There were no instruments outstanding at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022.

In connection with cash flow hedges of forecasted interest payments related to the company&#39;s borrowings, the company recorded net losses (before taxes) of $ 135 million and $ 139 million at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, in AOCI. The company estimates that $ 18 million of the deferred net losses (before taxes) on derivatives in AOCI at March 31, 2023 will be reclassified to net income within the next 12 months, providing an offsetting economic impact against the underlying interest payments.

Foreign Exchange Risk 

Long-Term Investments in Foreign Subsidiaries (Net Investment) 

A large portion of the company&#8217;s foreign currency denominated debt portfolio is designated as a hedge of net investment in foreign subsidiaries to reduce the volatility in stockholders&#8217; equity caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates in the functional currency of major foreign subsidiaries with respect to the U.S. dollar. At March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the carrying value of debt designated as hedging instruments was $ 15.2 billion and $ 13.4 billion, respectively. The company also uses cross-currency swaps and foreign exchange forward contracts for this risk management purpose. At March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the total notional amount of derivative instruments designated as net investment hedges was $ 5.0 billion and $ 4.7 billion, respectively. At March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the weighted-average remaining maturity of these instruments was approximately 0.2 years and 0.1 years, respectively.

Anticipated Royalties and Cost Transactions 

The company&#8217;s operations generate significant nonfunctional currency, third-party vendor payments and intercompany payments for royalties and goods and services among the company&#8217;s non-U.S. subsidiaries and with the company. In anticipation of these foreign currency cash flows and in view of the volatility of the currency markets, the company selectively employs foreign exchange forward contracts to manage its currency risk. These forward contracts 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements &#8212; (continued) 

are accounted for as cash flow hedges. At March 31, 2023, the maximum remaining length of time over which the company hedged its exposure is approximately two years . At March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the total notional amount of forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted royalty and cost transactions was $ 8.4 billion and $ 8.1 billion, respectively. At both March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the weighted-average remaining maturity of these instruments was approximately 0.6 years.

At March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, in connection with cash flow hedges of anticipated royalties and cost transactions, the company recorded net losses and net gains (before taxes) of $ 24 million and $ 66 million, respectively, in AOCI. The company estimates that $ 85 million of deferred net losses (before taxes) on derivatives in AOCI at March 31, 2023 will be reclassified to net income within the next 12 months, providing an offsetting economic impact against the underlying anticipated transactions.

Foreign Currency Denominated Borrowings 

The company is exposed to exchange rate volatility on foreign currency denominated debt. To manage this risk, the company employs cross-currency swaps to convert fixed-rate foreign currency denominated debt to fixed-rate debt denominated in the functional currency of the borrowing entity. These swaps are accounted for as cash flow hedges. At March 31, 2023, the maximum length of time remaining over which the company hedged its exposure is approximately eight years . At March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the total notional amount of cross-currency swaps designated as cash flow hedges of foreign currency denominated debt was $ 4.0 billion and $ 3.1 billion, respectively.

At March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, in connection with cash flow hedges of foreign currency denominated borrowings, the company recorded net losses (before taxes) of $ 166 million and $ 101 million, respectively, in AOCI. The company estimates that $ 41 million of deferred net gains (before taxes) on derivatives in AOCI at March 31, 2023 will be reclassified to net income within the next 12 months, providing an offsetting economic impact against the underlying exposure.

Subsidiary Cash and Foreign Currency Asset/Liability Management 

The company uses its Global Treasury Centers to manage the cash of its subsidiaries. These centers principally use currency swaps to convert cash flows in a cost-effective manner. In addition, the company uses foreign exchange forward contracts to economically hedge, on a net basis, the foreign currency exposure of a portion of the company&#8217;s nonfunctional currency assets and liabilities. The terms of these forward and swap contracts are generally less than one year . The changes in the fair values of these contracts and of the underlying hedged exposures are generally offsetting and are recorded in other (income) and expense in the Consolidated Income Statement. At March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the total notional amount of derivative instruments in economic hedges of foreign currency exposure was $ 8.4 billion and $ 5.9 billion, respectively.

Equity Risk Management 

The company is exposed to market price changes in certain broad market indices and in the company&#8217;s own stock primarily related to certain obligations to employees. Changes in the overall value of these employee compensation obligations are recorded in SG&#38;A expense in the Consolidated Income Statement. Although not designated as accounting hedges, the company utilizes equity swap derivatives to economically hedge the exposures related to its employee compensation obligations. The derivatives are linked to the total return on certain broad market indices or the total return on the company&#8217;s common stock, and are recorded at fair value with gains or losses also reported in SG&#38;A expense in the Consolidated Income Statement. At both March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the total notional amount of derivative instruments in economic hedges of these compensation obligations was $ 1.1 billion.

(2) The amount includes basis adjustments to the carrying value of the hedged item recorded during the period and amortization of basis adjustments recorded on de-designated hedging relationships during the period. (3) The company&#8217;s policy is to recognize all fair value changes in amounts excluded from effectiveness testing in net income each period. (4) Instruments in net investment hedges include derivative and non-derivative instruments with the amounts recognized in OCI providing an offset to the translation of foreign subsidiaries.

Pre-tax stock-based compensation cost for the three months ended March 31, 2023 increased $ 35 million compared to the corresponding period in the prior year, including increases in Employees Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) ($ 19 million) as a result of ESPP being considered compensatory effective April 1, 2022 and stock options ($ 14 million) due to the conversion of stock options previously issued by acquired entities and stock options granted by the company as part of its executive compensation programs. 

Total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested awards at March 31, 2023 was $ 1.7 billion and is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 2.6 years.

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

(Unaudited) 

1. OVERVIEW AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

Overview. Keysight Technologies, Inc. (""we,"" ""us,"" ""Keysight"" or the ""company""), incorporated in Delaware on December 6, 2013, is a technology company that helps enterprises, service providers and governments accelerate innovation to connect and secure the world by providing electronic design and test solutions that are used in the simulation, design, validation, manufacture, installation, optimization and secure operation of electronics systems in the communications, networking and electronics industries. We also offer customization, consulting and optimization services throughout the customer's product development lifecycle, including start-up assistance, asset management, up-time services, application services and instrument calibration and repair. 

Our fiscal year-end is October 31, and our fiscal quarters end on January 31, April 30 and July 31. Unless otherwise stated, these dates refer to our fiscal year and fiscal quarters. 

Basis of Presentation . We have prepared the accompanying financial statements pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC""). Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (""GAAP"") have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. The accompanying financial statements and information should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

In the opinion of management, the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements contain all normal and recurring adjustments necessary to state fairly our financial position as of January 31, 2023 and October 31, 2022, results of operations for the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, and cash flows for the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022. 

Use of Estimates. The preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable. Although these estimates are based on management&#8217;s knowledge of current events and actions that may impact the company in the future, actual results may be different from the estimates. 

Update to Significant Accounting Policies. Except as set forth in the ""new accounting pronouncements"" section below, there have been no material changes to our significant accounting policies as described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2022. 

Reclassifications . Beginning in fiscal year 2023, to align the presentation of revenue with the manner in which management reviews such information, the presentation of ""products"" and ""services and other"" revenue and the presentation of ""costs and expenses"" in the condensed consolidated statement of operations were reclassified to move revenue and costs and expenses primarily related to bundled licenses and KeysightCare services from products to services and other. This resulted in reclassification of $ 20 million from ""products"" revenue to ""services and other"" revenue and $ 3 million from ""cost of products"" to ""cost of services and other"" for the three months ended January 31, 2022 to conform to the current presentation. This change had no impact on reported total revenue, income from operations and net income in our condensed consolidated statement of operations. 

New Accounting Pronouncements. Other amendments to GAAP that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected to have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements upon adoption. 

2. REVENUE 

Disaggregation of Revenue 

We disaggregate our revenue from contracts with customers by geographic region, end market, and timing of revenue recognition, as we believe these categories best depict how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of our revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors. Disaggregated revenue is presented for each of our reportable segments, Communications Solutions Group (""CSG"") and Electronics Industrial Solutions Group (""EISG""). 

Three Months Ended January 31, 2023 2022 CSG EISG Total CSG EISG Total &#160; (in millions) Region Americas $ 452 &#160; $ 109 &#160; $ 561 &#160; $ 404 &#160; $ 79 &#160; $ 483 &#160; Europe 147 &#160; 110 &#160; 257 &#160; 143 &#160; 83 &#160; 226 &#160; Asia Pacific 340 &#160; 223 &#160; 563 &#160; 331 &#160; 210 &#160; 541 &#160; Total revenue $ 939 &#160; $ 442 &#160; $ 1,381 &#160; $ 878 &#160; $ 372 &#160; $ 1,250 &#160; End Market Aerospace, Defense &#38; Government $ 310 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 310 &#160; $ 294 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 294 &#160; Commercial Communications 629 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 629 &#160; 584 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 584 &#160; Electronic Industrial &#8212; &#160; 442 &#160; 442 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 372 &#160; 372 &#160; Total revenue $ 939 &#160; $ 442 &#160; $ 1,381 &#160; $ 878 &#160; $ 372 &#160; $ 1,250 &#160; Timing of Revenue Recognition Revenue recognized at a point in time $ 777 &#160; $ 380 &#160; $ 1,157 &#160; $ 730 &#160; $ 322 &#160; $ 1,052 &#160; Revenue recognized over time 162 &#160; 62 &#160; 224 &#160; 148 &#160; 50 &#160; 198 &#160; Total revenue $ 939 &#160; $ 442 &#160; $ 1,381 &#160; $ 878 &#160; $ 372 &#160; $ 1,250 &#160; 

Our point-in-time revenues are generated predominantly from the sale of various types of design and test software and hardware, and per-incident repair and calibration services. Perpetual software and the portion of term software subscription revenue in this category represents revenue recognized up front upon transfer of control at the time of electronic delivery. Revenue on per-incident repair and calibration services is recognized when services are performed. Over-time revenues are generated predominantly from the repair and calibration contracts, extended warranties, technical support for hardware and software, certain software subscription and Software as a Service (""SaaS"") product offerings, and professional services. Technical support for software and when-and-if available software updates and upgrades are sold either together with our software licenses and software subscriptions, including SaaS, or separately as part of our customer support programs. 

Additionally, we provide custom solutions that include combinations of hardware, software, software subscriptions, installation, professional services, and other support services, and revenue may be recognized either up front on delivery or over time depending upon the terms of the contract. 

Contract Balances 

Contract assets 

Contract assets consist of unbilled receivables and are recorded when revenue is recognized in advance of scheduled billings to our customers. These amounts are primarily related to solutions and support arrangements when transfer of control has occurred but we have not yet invoiced. The contract assets balance was $ 72 million and $ 88 million as of January 31, 2023 and October 31, 2022, respectively, and is included in ""accounts receivables, net"" and ""other assets"" in our condensed consolidated balance sheet. 

Contract costs 

We capitalize direct and incremental costs incurred to acquire contracts for which the associated revenue is expected to be recognized in future periods. We have determined that certain employee and third-party representative commission programs meet the requirements to be capitalized. These costs are initially deferred and typically amortized over the term of the customer contract which corresponds to the period of benefit. Capitalized contract costs were $ 39 million and $ 38 million as of January 

31, 2023 and October 31, 2022, respectively, and are included in &#8220;other current assets&#8221; and &#8220;other assets&#8221; in the condensed consolidated balance sheet. The amortization expense associated with these costs was $ 19 million and $ 22 million for the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 

Contract liabilities 

Our contract liabilities consist of deferred revenue that arises when we receive consideration in advance of providing the goods or services promised in the contract. Contract liabilities are primarily generated from customer deposits received in advance of shipments for products or rendering of services and are recognized as revenue when services are provided to the customer. We classify deferred revenue as current or non-current based on the timing of when we expect to recognize revenue. 

The following table provides a roll-forward of our contract liabilities, current and non-current: 

Three Months Ended January 31, 2023 (in millions) Balance at October 31, 2022 $ 692 &#160; Deferral of revenue billed in current period, net of recognition 279 &#160; Revenue recognized that was deferred as of the beginning of the period ( 217 ) Foreign currency translation impact 17 &#160; Balance at January 31, 2023 $ 771 &#160; 

Remaining Performance Obligations 

Our remaining performance obligations, excluding contracts that have an original expected duration of one year or less, was approximately $ 479 million as of January 31, 2023, and represents the company&#8217;s obligation to deliver products and services and obtain customer acceptance on delivered products. As of January 31, 2023, we expect to fulfill 38 percent of these unsatisfied performance obligations during the remainder of 2023 , 37 percent during 2024 , and 25 percent thereafter. 

3. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION 

Keysight accounts for share-based awards in accordance with the provisions of the authoritative accounting guidance, which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to our employees and directors, including restricted stock units (""RSUs""), employee stock purchases made under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan (&#8220;ESPP&#8221;), and performance share awards granted to selected members of our senior management under the Long-Term Performance (&#8220;LTP&#8221;) Program, based on estimated fair values. The impact of share-based compensation expense on our condensed consolidated statement of operations was as follows: 

Three Months Ended January 31, &#160; 2023 2022 &#160; (in millions) Cost of products and services $ 9 &#160; $ 8 &#160; Research and development 16 &#160; 11 &#160; Selling, general and administrative 30 &#160; 32 &#160; Total share-based compensation expense $ 55 &#160; $ 51 &#160; 

Share-based compensation capitalized within inventory was $ 4 million and $ 3 million at January 31, 2023 and January 31, 2022, respectively. 

Performance awards based on total shareholder return (""TSR"") are valued using a Monte Carlo simulation model, which requires the use of highly subjective and complex assumptions, including the price volatility of the underlying stock. The valuation is done once every year in the first quarter at the time of annual grants. The estimated fair value of RSUs and the financial metrics-based performance awards (both operating margin and earnings per share) is determined based on the market price of Keysight&#8217;s common stock on the grant date. The compensation cost for financial metrics-based performance awards reflects the cost of awards that are probable to vest at the end of the performance period. 

The following assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of TSR-based performance awards: 

Three Months Ended January 31, &#160; 2023 2022 Volatility of Keysight shares 35 &#160; % 36 &#160; % Volatility of S&#38;P 500 Total Return index 25 &#160; % 23 &#160; % Price-wise correlation with selected peers 75 &#160; % 67 &#160; % 

4. INCOME TAXES 

The following table provides details of income taxes: 

&#160; Three Months Ended January 31, &#160; 2023 2022 in millions, except percentages Income before taxes $ 331 $ 264 Provision for income taxes $ 71 $ 35 Effective tax rate 21.5 &#160; % 13.1 &#160; % 

The effective tax rate increased 8.4 percentage points from the three months ended January 31, 2022 to the three months ended January 31, 2023 due to an increase in income before taxes, the impacts of U.S. tax research and experimental expenditures capitalization, and a decrease in discrete tax benefits. A provision enacted in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the ""TCJA"") became effective for Keysight on November 1, 2022 requiring U.S. tax research and experimental expenditures to be capitalized and amortized over five years for research activities conducted in the U.S. and over fifteen years for research activities conducted outside the U.S. The capitalization of U.S. tax research and experimental expenditures increases the provision for global intangible low-taxed income (&#8220;GILTI&#8221;) and is partially offset by an increase in the Foreign-Derived Intangible Income tax deduction. 

The income tax expense for the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022 included a net discrete benefit of $ 1 million and $ 8 million, respectively. The decrease in discrete tax benefit for the three months ended January 31, 2023 was primarily due to a decrease in tax deductions related to stock compensation. 

Keysight benefits from tax incentives in several jurisdictions, most significantly in Singapore and Malaysia, that will expire or require renewal at various times in the future. The tax incentives provide lower rates of taxation on certain classes of income and require thresholds of investments and employment in those jurisdictions. The Singapore tax incentive is due for renewal in 2024, and the Malaysia incentive is due for renewal in 2025. We are continuing to evaluate renewal options and the impact of potential outcomes on our effective tax rate. For the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022 the impact of the tax incentives decreased the income tax provision by $ 25 million and $ 19 million, respectively. The increase in tax benefit for the three months ended January 31, 2023 is primarily due to a change in the jurisdictional mix of non-U.S. earnings, which increased the earnings taxed at incentive tax rates in 2023. 

The open tax years for the U.S. federal income tax return and most state income tax returns are from November 1, 2018 through the current tax year. For the majority of our non-U.S. entities, the open tax years are from November 1, 2017 through the current tax year. For certain non-U.S. entities, the tax years remain open, at most, back to the year 2008. 

The company is being audited in Malaysia for fiscal year 2008 . This tax year pre-dates our separation from Agilent. However, pursuant to the agreement between Agilent and Keysight pertaining to tax matters, as finalized at the time of separation, for certain entities, including Malaysia, any historical tax liability is the responsibility of Keysight. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017, Keysight paid income taxes and penalties of $ 68 million on gains related to intellectual property rights. The company believes there are numerous defenses to the current assessment; the statute of limitations for the fiscal year 2008 in Malaysia was closed, and the income in question is exempt from tax in Malaysia. The company is disputing this assessment and pursuing all avenues to resolve this issue favorably for the company. Our appeals to both the Special Commissioners of Income Tax and the High Court in Malaysia have been unsuccessful. We have filed a Notice of Appeal with the Court of Appeal, and a hearing is currently scheduled for April 2023. 

At this time, management does not believe that the outcome of any future or currently ongoing examination will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. We believe that we have an adequate provision for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax examinations cannot be predicted with certainty. Given the numerous tax years and matters that remain subject to examination in various tax jurisdictions, the ultimate resolution of current 

and future tax examinations could be inconsistent with management&#8217;s current expectations. If that were to occur, it could have an impact on our effective tax rate in the period in which such examinations are resolved. 

5. NET INCOME PER SHARE 

The following table presents the calculation of basic and diluted net income per share: 

Three Months Ended January 31, &#160; 2023 2022 in millions, except per-share amounts Net income $ 260 &#160; $ 229 &#160; Basic weighted-average shares 178 &#160; 183 &#160; Potential common shares&#8212; stock options and other employee stock plans 2 &#160; 1 &#160; Diluted weighted-average shares 180 &#160; 184 &#160; Net income per share - basic $ 1.46 &#160; $ 1.25 &#160; Net income per share - diluted $ 1.45 &#160; $ 1.24 &#160; 

Diluted shares outstanding primarily include the dilutive effect of non-vested RSUs and in-the-money options. The diluted effect of such awards is calculated based on the average share price of each period using the treasury stock method, except where the inclusion of such awards would have an anti-dilutive impact. Anti-dilutive shares excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share were no t material for the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022. 

6. GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS 

The goodwill balance as of January 31, 2023 and October 31, 2022 and the activity for the three months ended January 31, 2023 for each of our reportable operating segments were as follows: 

&#160; CSG EISG Total &#160; (in millions) Goodwill at October 31, 2022 $ 1,022 &#160; $ 560 &#160; $ 1,582 &#160; Foreign currency translation impact 25 &#160; 4 &#160; 29 &#160; Goodwill at January 31, 2023 $ 1,047 &#160; $ 564 &#160; $ 1,611 &#160; 

There were no impairments for three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022. As of January 31, 2023 and October 31, 2022, accumulated impairment losses on goodwill was $ 709 million. 

Other intangible assets as of January 31, 2023 and October 31, 2022 consisted of the following:

Goodwill is assessed for impairment on a reporting unit basis at least annually in the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently when events and circumstances occur indicating that the recorded goodwill may be impaired. The company has not identified any triggering events that indicate an impairment of goodwill for the three months ended January 31, 2023. 

Amortization of other intangible assets was $ 23 million and $ 26 million for the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 

Estimated intangible assets amortization expense for each of the five succeeding fiscal years is as follows: 

Amortization expense (in millions) 2023 (remainder) $ 59 &#160; 2024 $ 43 &#160; 2025 $ 25 &#160; 2026 $ 16 &#160; 2027 $ 9 &#160; Thereafter $ 14 &#160; 

7. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS 

The authoritative guidance defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required or permitted to be recorded at fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market and assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. 

Fair Value Hierarchy 

The guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes inputs used in valuation techniques into three levels. A financial instrument&#8217;s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. There are three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value: 

Level 1 - applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 

Level 2 - applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, for the asset or liability such as: quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in less active markets; or other inputs that can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data. 

Level 3 - applies to assets or liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities. 

Financial Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis 

Financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of January 31, 2023 and October 31, 2022 were as follows: 

Fair Value Measurements at &#160; January 31, 2023 October 31, 2022 &#160; Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Other Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Other &#160; (in millions) Assets: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Short-term &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Cash equivalents Money market funds $ 1,471 &#160; $ 1,471 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; $ 1,338 &#160; $ 1,338 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; Derivative instruments (foreign exchange contracts) 15 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 15 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; 21 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 21 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; Long-term Derivative instruments (interest rate swaps) 109 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 109 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; 133 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 133 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; Equity investments 56 &#160; 56 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; 50 &#160; 50 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; Other Investments 19 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 19 &#160; 12 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 12 &#160; Total assets measured at fair value $ 1,670 &#160; $ 1,527 &#160; $ 124 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 19 &#160; $ 1,554 &#160; $ 1,388 &#160; $ 154 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 12 &#160; Liabilities: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Short-term Derivative instruments (foreign exchange contracts) $ 12 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 12 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; $ 12 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 12 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; Long-term Deferred compensation liability 25 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 25 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; 22 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 22 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; Total liabilities measured at fair value $ 37 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 37 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; $ 34 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 34 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; 

Net realized gain (loss) on sale of our equity investments was zero for both the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022. Net unrealized gain (loss) on our equity and other investments was a gain of $ 8 million and a loss of $ 4 million for the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 

8. DERIVATIVES 

We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and interest rate changes in the normal course of our business. As part of our risk management strategy, we use derivative instruments, primarily forward contracts, to hedge economic and/or accounting exposures resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. 

Cash Flow Hedges 

We enter into foreign exchange contracts to hedge our forecasted operational cash flow exposures resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These foreign exchange contracts, carried at fair value, have maturities based on a rolling period of up to twelve months. These derivative instruments are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges under the criteria prescribed in the authoritative guidance. 

In 2020, we entered into forward starting interest rate swaps arrangement with an aggregate notional amount of $ 600 million associated with future interest payments on anticipated debt issuances through fiscal year 2024. We designated these derivative instruments as a cash flow hedge. In February 2023, we terminated the interest rate swap arrangement resulting in a deferred gain of $107 million in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to be amortized to interest expense over the term of the anticipated debt. The termination of the arrangement had no impact on the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. 

Non-designated Hedges 

Additionally, we enter into foreign exchange contracts to hedge monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries. These foreign exchange contracts are carried at fair value and do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and are not designated as hedging instruments. 

The number of open foreign exchange forward contracts designated as ""cash flow hedges"" and ""not designated as hedging instruments"" was 210 and 69 , respectively, as of January 31, 2023. The aggregated notional amounts by currency and designation as of January 31, 2023 were as follows: 

&#160; Derivatives in Cash Flow Hedging Relationships Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments &#160; Forward Contracts Forward Contracts Currency Buy/(Sell) Buy/(Sell) &#160; (in millions) Euro $ 5 &#160; $ 10 &#160; British Pound 18 &#160; ( 39 ) Singapore Dollar 35 &#160; 37 &#160; Malaysian Ringgit 119 &#160; 17 &#160; Japanese Yen ( 162 ) ( 72 ) Other currencies ( 19 ) ( 41 ) Total $ ( 4 ) $ ( 88 ) 

Derivative instruments are subject to master netting arrangements and are disclosed gross in the condensed consolidated balance sheet. The gross fair values and balance sheet presentation of derivative instruments held as of January 31, 2023 and October 31, 2022 were as follows: 

Fair Values of Derivative Instruments Assets Derivatives Liabilities Derivatives Fair Value &#160; Fair Value Balance Sheet Location January 31, 2023 October 31, 2022 Balance Sheet Location January 31, 2023 October 31, 2022 (in millions) Derivatives designated as hedging instruments: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Cash flow hedges Foreign exchange contracts &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Other current assets $ 12 &#160; $ 18 &#160; Other accrued liabilities $ 8 &#160; $ 10 &#160; Interest rate swap contracts: Other assets 109 &#160; 133 &#160; Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Foreign exchange contracts &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Other current assets 3 &#160; 3 &#160; Other accrued liabilities 4 &#160; 2 &#160; Total derivatives $ 124 &#160; $ 154 &#160; &#160; $ 12 &#160; $ 12 &#160; 

The effect of derivative instruments for foreign exchange contracts designated as hedging instruments and for those not designated as hedging instruments in our condensed consolidated statement of operations was as follows: 

Three Months Ended January 31, 2023 2022 &#160; (in millions) Derivatives designated as hedging instruments: Cash Flow Hedges Interest rate swap contracts: Gain (loss) recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) $ ( 24 ) $ 8 &#160; Foreign exchange contracts: Gain (loss) recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) $ ( 3 ) $ ( 3 ) Gain (loss) reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into earnings: Cost of products $ 4 &#160; $ 1 &#160; Selling, general and administrative $ ( 2 ) $ ( 1 ) Gain (loss) excluded from effectiveness testing recognized in earnings based on amortization approach: Cost of products $ 1 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments: Gain (loss) recognized in: Other income (expense), net $ ( 4 ) $ 3 &#160; 

The estimated amount at January 31, 2023 expected to be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to earnings within the next twelve months is a gain of $ 2 million. 

9. DEBT 

The following table summarizes the components of our long-term debt:

Short-Term Debt 

Revolving Credit Facility 

On July 30, 2021 , we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement that amended and restated the prior credit agreement dated February 15, 2017 in its entirety which provides for a $ 750 million five-year unsecured revolving credit facility (the &#8220;Revolving Credit Facility&#8221;) that will expire on July 30, 2026 and bears interest at an annual rate of LIBOR + 1 percent along with a facility fee of 0.125 percent per annum. In addition, the credit agreement permits the company, subject to certain customary conditions, on one or more occasions to request to increase the total commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility by up to $ 250 million in the aggregate. We may use amounts borrowed under the facility for general corporate purposes. As of January 31, 2023 and October 31, 2022, we had no borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility. We were in compliance with the covenants of the Revolving Credit Facility during the three months ended January 31, 2023 . On February 17, 2023 , we entered into the first amendment to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement to change the annual interest rate from LIBOR + 1 percent to SOFR + 1.1 percent . 

Long-Term Debt 

There have been no changes to the principal, maturity, interest rates and interest payment terms of the senior notes during the three months ended January 31, 2023 as compared to the senior notes described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2022. We were in compliance with the covenants of our senior notes during the three months ended January 31, 2023 . 

As of January 31, 2023 and October 31, 2022, we had $ 44 million and $ 38 million, respectively, of outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds unrelated to the credit facility that were issued by various lenders. 

The fair value of our long-term debt, which is calculated from quoted prices that are primarily Level 1 inputs under the accounting guidance fair value hierarchy is approximately $ 1,747 million and $ 1,679 million as of January 31, 2023 and October 31, 2022, respectively . 

10. RETIREMENT PLANS AND POST-RETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS 

For the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, our net pension and post-retirement benefit cost (benefit) was comprised of the following: 

&#160; Pensions &#160; &#160; U.S. Defined Benefit Plans Non-U.S. Defined Benefit Plans U.S. Post-Retirement Benefit Plan &#160; Three Months Ended January 31, &#160; 2023 2022 2023 2022 2023 2022 (in millions) Service cost&#8212;benefits earned during the period $ 4 &#160; $ 6 &#160; $ 2 &#160; $ 3 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; Interest cost on benefit obligation 9 &#160; 6 &#160; 7 &#160; 4 &#160; 2 &#160; 1 &#160; Expected return on plan assets ( 12 ) ( 15 ) ( 12 ) ( 15 ) ( 3 ) ( 4 ) Amortization of net actuarial loss 2 &#160; 3 &#160; 2 &#160; 6 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Net periodic benefit cost (benefit) $ 3 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ ( 1 ) $ ( 2 ) $ ( 1 ) $ ( 3 ) 

We record the service cost component of net periodic benefit cost (benefit) in the same line item as other employee compensation costs. The non-service components of net periodic benefit cost (benefit), such as interest cost, expected return on assets, amortization of prior service cost, and actuarial gains or losses, are recorded within ""other income (expense), net"" in the condensed consolidated statement of operations. 

We did no t contribute to our U.S. defined benefit plans or U.S. post-retirement benefit plan during the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022. We contributed $ 3 million to our non-U.S. defined benefit plans during both the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022. 

For the remainder of 2023, we do no t expect to contribute to our U.S. defined benefit plan and U.S. post-retirement benefit plan, and we expect to contribute $ 7 million to our non-U.S. defined benefit plans. The amounts we contribute depend upon, among other things, legal requirements, underlying asset returns, the plan&#8217;s funded status, the anticipated tax deductibility of the contribution, local practices, employee retirements, market conditions, interest rates and other factors. 

11. SUPPLEMENTAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION 

The following tables provide details of selected balance sheet items: 

Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash 

January 31, 2023 October 31, 2022 (in millions) Cash and cash equivalents $ 2,228 &#160; $ 2,042 &#160; Restricted cash included in other assets 16 &#160; 15 &#160; Total cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash shown in the statement of cash flows $ 2,244 &#160; $ 2,057 &#160;

Standard warranty 

Our warranties on products sold through direct sales channels are primarily for one year. Warranties for products sold through distribution channels are primarily for three years. We accrue for standard warranty costs based on historical trends in warranty charges. The accrual is reviewed regularly and periodically adjusted to reflect changes in warranty cost estimates. Estimated warranty charges are recorded within cost of products at the time related product revenue is recognized. 

Activity related to the standard warranty accrual, which is included in other accrued and other long-term liabilities in our condensed consolidated balance sheet, is as follows: 

&#160; Three Months Ended January 31, &#160; 2023 2022 &#160; (in millions) Beginning balance $ 32 &#160; $ 34 &#160; Accruals for warranties, including change in estimates 9 &#160; 7 &#160; Settlements made during the period ( 7 ) ( 6 ) Ending balance $ 34 &#160; $ 35 &#160; Accruals for warranties due within one year $ 20 &#160; $ 21 &#160; Accruals for warranties due after one year 14 &#160; 14 &#160; Ending balance $ 34 &#160; $ 35 &#160;

During the three months ended January 31, 2023, there were no other material changes to the purchase commitments as reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2022. 

Contingencies 

On August 3, 2021, we entered into a Consent Agreement with the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls, Bureau of Political-Military Affairs, Department of State to resolve alleged violations of the Arms Export Control Act and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (""ITAR""). Pursuant to the Consent Agreement, we were assessed a penalty of $ 6.6 million to be paid over three years, $ 2.5 million of which is suspended and designated for remediation activities over three years, including employment of a special compliance officer. To date, we have paid $ 2.1 million of the penalty. The suspended portion of the penalty has been satisfied by amounts we have spent on qualifying compliance activities to date. 

On January 1, 2022, Centripetal Networks filed a lawsuit in Federal District Court in Virginia, alleging that certain Keysight products infringe certain of Centripetal&#8217;s patents. In addition, in February 2022 Centripetal filed complaints in Germany alleging infringement of certain of Centripetal&#8217;s German patents, and in April 2022 Centripetal filed a complaint with the International Trade Commission (&#8220;ITC&#8221;) requesting that they investigate whether Keysight should be enjoined from importing certain products that are manufactured outside of the U.S. and which are alleged to infringe Centripetal patents. We deny the allegations and are aggressively defending each case. Although there are no matters pending that we currently believe are probable and reasonably possible of having a material impact to our business, consolidated financial position, or results of operations or cash flows, the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain and is difficult to predict. An adverse outcome in any outstanding lawsuit or proceeding could result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief. If adverse results are above management&#8217;s expectations or are unforeseen, management may not have accrued for the liability, which could impact our results in a financial period. 

We are also involved in lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings, including, but not limited to, patent, employment, commercial and environmental matters, which arise in the ordinary course of business. 

13. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY 

Stock Repurchase Program 

On November 18, 2021, our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing the purchase of up to $ 1,200 million of the company&#8217;s common stock, replacing the previously approved November 2020 program, under which $ 77 million remained. Under our stock repurchase program, shares may be purchased from time to time, subject to general business and market conditions and other investment opportunities, through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or other means. All such shares and related costs are held as treasury stock and accounted for at trade date using the cost method. The stock repurchase program may be commenced, suspended or discontinued at any time at the company&#8217;s discretion and does not have an expiration date. 

For the three months ended January 31, 2023, we repurchased 710,736 shares of common stock for $ 125 million. For the three months ended January 31, 2022, we repurchased 1,128,733 shares of common stock for $ 206 million. 

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss 

Changes in accumulated other comprehensive loss by component and related tax effects for the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022 were as follows:

Reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive loss for the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022 were as follows:

An amount in parentheses indicates a reduction to income and an increase to accumulated other comprehensive loss. 

Reclassifications of net actuarial loss related to retirement plans and post retirement pension plans are included in the computation of net periodic benefit cost (see Note 10, ""Retirement Plans and Post-Retirement Benefit Plans""). 

14. SEGMENT INFORMATION 

We report our results in two reportable segments: Communications Solutions Group (""CSG"") and Electronic Industrial Solutions Group (""EISG""). The results of our reportable segments are based on our management reporting system and are not necessarily in conformity with GAAP. The performance of each segment is measured based on several metrics, including income from operations. These results are used, in part, by the chief operating decision maker in evaluating the performance of, and in allocating resources to each of the segments. 

The profitability of each of the segments is measured after excluding share-based compensation expense, amortization of acquisition-related balances, acquisition and integration costs, restructuring costs, interest income, interest expense and other items as noted in the reconciliations below. 

Three Months Ended January 31, 2023 2022 CSG EISG Total CSG EISG Total &#160; (in millions) Revenue $ 939 &#160; $ 442 &#160; $ 1,381 &#160; $ 878 &#160; $ 372 &#160; $ 1,250 &#160; Segment income from operations $ 269 &#160; $ 140 &#160; $ 409 &#160; $ 237 &#160; $ 114 &#160; $ 351 &#160;

15. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS 

On February 7, 2023 , we completed the acquisition of Cliosoft Inc. for approximately $ 100 million, net of cash acquired. Cliosoft's data and IP management tools enhance our portfolio of electronics design automation solutions. Cliosoft&#8217;s results will be included in Keysight&#8217;s consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition and will be reported in the CSG and EISG operating segments.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

(UNAUDITED) 

References in the Notes to ""Lumen Technologies"" or ""Lumen,"" ""we,"" ""us,"" the ""Company,"" and ""our"" refer to Lumen Technologies, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise requires. References in the Notes to ""Level 3"" refer to Level 3 Parent, LLC and its predecessor, Level 3 Communications, Inc., which we acquired on November 1, 2017. 

(1) Background 

General 

We are an international facilities-based technology and communications company focused on providing our business and mass markets customers with a broad array of integrated products and services necessary to fully participate in our ever-evolving digital world. We operate one of the world&#8217;s most interconnected networks. Our platform empowers our customers to swiftly adjust digital programs securely to meet immediate demands, create efficiencies, accelerate market access and reduce costs - allowing customers to rapidly evolve their IT programs to address dynamic changes. Our specific products and services are detailed in Note 4&#8212;Revenue Recognition. 

Basis of Presentation 

Our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022, which was derived from our audited consolidated financial statements, and our unaudited interim consolidated financial statements provided herein have been prepared in accordance with the instructions for Form 10-Q. Certain information and note disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (""GAAP"") have been condensed or omitted pursuant to rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC""). However, in our opinion, the disclosures made therein are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. We believe these consolidated financial statements include all normal recurring adjustments necessary to fairly present the results for the interim periods. The consolidated results of operations and cash flows for the first three months of the year are not necessarily indicative of the consolidated results of operations and cash flows that might be expected for the entire year. These consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. 

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include our accounts and the accounts of our subsidiaries in which we have a controlling interest. Intercompany amounts and transactions with our consolidated subsidiaries have been eliminated. 

To simplify the overall presentation of our consolidated financial statements, we report immaterial amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests in certain of our subsidiaries as follows: (i) income attributable to noncontrolling interests in other (expense) income, net, (ii) equity attributable to noncontrolling interests in additional paid-in capital and (iii) cash flows attributable to noncontrolling interests in other, net financing activities. 

We reclassified certain prior period amounts to conform to the current period presentation, including the recategorization of our Business revenue by product category and sales channel in our segment reporting. See Note 11&#8212;Segment Information for additional information. These changes had no impact on total operating revenue, total operating expenses or net income for any period. 

Operating lease assets are included in other, net under goodwill and other assets on our consolidated balance sheets. Noncurrent operating lease liabilities are included in other under deferred credits and other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. 

There were no book overdrafts included in accounts payable at March 31, 2023 or December 31, 2022. 

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

Refer to the significant accounting policies described in Note 1&#8212; Background and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in Part II, Item 8 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. 

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements 

Supplier Finance Programs 

On January 1, 2023, we adopted Accounting Standards Update (""ASU"") ASU 2022-04, &#8220;Liabilities-Supplier Finance Program (Subtopic 405-50): Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations &#8221; (&#8220;ASU 2022-04&#8221;). These amendments require that a company that uses a supplier finance program in connection with the purchase of goods or services disclose sufficient information about the program to allow a user of financial statements to understand the program&#8217;s nature, program activity during the period, changes from period to period and potential magnitude of program transactions. The adoption of ASU 2022-04 did not have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements. 

Credit Losses 

On January 1, 2023, we adopted ASU 2022-02, &#8220; Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings (&#8220;TDR&#8221;) and Vintage Disclosures &#8221; (&#8220;ASU 2022-02&#8221;). The ASU eliminates the TDR recognition and measurement guidance, enhances existing disclosure requirements and introduces new requirements related to certain modifications of receivables made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. The adoption of ASU 2022-02 did not have any impact to our consolidated financial statements. 

Derivatives and Hedging 

On January 1, 2023, we adopted ASU 2022-01, &#8220; Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Fair Value Hedging-Portfolio Layer Method &#8221; (""ASU 2022-01""). The ASU expands the current single-layer method to allow multiple hedged layers of a single closed portfolio under the method. The adoption of ASU 2022-01 did not have any impact to our consolidated financial statements. 

Business Combinations 

On January 1, 2023, we adopted ASU 2021-08, &#8220; Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers &#8221; (&#8220;ASU 2021-08&#8221;). This ASU requires entities to apply Topic 606 to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities in a business combination. The adoption of ASU 2021-08 did not have any impact to our consolidated financial statements. 

Government Assistance 

On January 1, 2022, we adopted ASU 2021-10, "" Government Assistance (Topic 832): Disclosures by Business Entities about Government Assistance &#8221; (&#8220;ASU 2021-10&#8221;). This ASU requires business entities to disclose information about certain types of government assistance they receive. The ASU only impacts annual financial statement note disclosures. The adoption of ASU 2021-10 did not have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements. 

Leases 

On January 1, 2022, we adopted ASU 2021-05, &#8220; Leases (Topic 842): Lessors&#8212;Certain Leases with Variable Lease Payments &#8221; (&#8220;ASU 2021-05&#8221;). This ASU (i) amends the lease classification requirements for lessors to align them with practice under ASC Topic 840, (ii) provides criteria for lessors to classify and account for a lease with variable lease payments that do not depend on a reference index or a rate as an operating lease; and (iii) provides guidance with respect to net investments by lessors under operating leases and other related topics. The adoption of ASU 2021-05 did not have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements. 

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 

In March 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#8220;FASB&#8221;) issued ASU 2023-02, &#8220; Investments-Equity method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit Structures Using the Proportional Amortization Method &#8221; (&#8220;ASU 2023-02&#8221;). These amendments allow reporting entities to elect to account for qualifying tax equity investments using the proportional amortization method, regardless of the program giving rise to the related income tax credits. ASU 2023-02 will become effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 and early adoption is permitted. As of March 31, 2023, we do not expect ASU 2023-02 to have an impact to our consolidated financial statements. 

In March 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-01, &#8220; Leases (Topic 842): Common Control Arrangements &#8221; (&#8220;ASU 2023-01&#8221;). These amendments require all entities to amortize leasehold improvements associated with common control leases over the useful life to the common control group. ASU 2023-01 will become effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 and early adoption is permitted. As of March 31, 2023, we do not expect ASU 2023-01 to have an impact to our consolidated financial statements. 

In June 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-03, &#8220; Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions &#8221; (&#8220;ASU 2022-03&#8221;). These amendments clarify that a contractual restriction on the sales of an investment in an equity security is not considered part of the unit of account of the equity security and, therefore, is not considered in measuring fair value. ASU 2022-03 will become effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 and early adoption is permitted. As of March 31, 2023, we do not expect ASU 2022-03 to have an impact to our consolidated financial statements. 

(2) Planned Divestiture of the EMEA Business 

On November 2, 2022, affiliates of Level 3 Parent, LLC, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Lumen Technologies, Inc., granted an option to Colt Technology Services Group Limited, a portfolio company of Fidelity Investments, to purchase certain of their operations in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (the ""EMEA business""), in exchange for $ 1.8 billion in cash, subject to certain working capital and other purchase price adjustments. Following the completion of a French consultative process, Colt exercised its option and on February 8, 2023, the parties entered into a definitive purchase agreement, which contains various customary covenants for transactions of this type including various indemnities. Level 3 Parent, LLC expects to close the transaction as early as late 2023, subject to receiving all requisite regulatory approvals in the U.S. and certain countries where the EMEA business operates, as well as the satisfaction of other customary conditions. 

The actual amount of our net after-tax proceeds from this divestiture could vary substantially from the amounts we currently estimate, particularly if we experience delays in completing the transaction or if any of our other assumptions prove to be incorrect. 

We do not believe this divestiture represents a strategic shift for Lumen. Therefore, the planned divestiture of the EMEA business does not meet the criteria to be classified as discontinued operations. As a result, we will continue to report our operating results for the EMEA business (the ""disposal group"") in our consolidated operating results until the transaction is closed. 

As of March 31, 2023 in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet, the assets and liabilities of our EMEA business are classified as held for sale and measured at the lower of (i) the carrying value when we classified the disposal group as held for sale and (ii) the fair value of the disposal group, less costs to sell. Effective with the designation of the disposal group as held for sale on November 2, 2022, we suspended recording depreciation of property, plant and equipment and amortization of finite-lived intangible assets and right-of-use assets while these assets are classified as held for sale. We estimate that we would have recorded an additional $ 72 million of depreciation, intangible amortization, and amortization of right-of-use assets for the three months ended March 31, 2023 if the EMEA business did not meet the held for sale criteria. 

The classification of the EMEA business as held for sale was considered an event or change in circumstance which requires an assessment of the goodwill of the disposal group for impairment each reporting period until disposal. We performed a pre-classification and post-classification goodwill impairment test of the disposal group as described further in Note 3&#8212;Goodwill, Customer Relationships and Other Intangible Assets in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. As a result of our impairment tests, we determined the EMEA business disposal group was impaired resulting in a non-cash, non-tax-deductible goodwill impairment charge of $ 43 million. We evaluated the recoverability of the carrying value of the assets and liabilities held for sale relative to the agreed upon sales price, adjusted for costs to sell, and recorded an estimated loss on disposal of $ 660 million during the year ended December 31, 2022 in the consolidated statement of operations and a valuation allowance included in assets held for sale on the consolidated balance sheet. As a result of our evaluation of the recoverability of the carrying value of the EMEA assets and liabilities held for sale relative to the agreed upon sales price, adjusted for costs to sell, as of March 31, 2023, we recorded an additional $ 77 million estimated loss on disposal during the three months ended March 31, 2023 and increased the valuation allowance by the same amount. In future quarters, we will conduct similar evaluations and to adjust the valuation allowance for the EMEA assets held for sale, as necessary. 

The principal components of the held for sale assets and liabilities of the EMEA business as of the dates below are as follows: 

March 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 (Dollars in millions) Assets held for sale Cash and cash equivalents $ 40 &#160; 43 &#160; Accounts receivable, less allowance of $ 5 and $ 5

(3) Goodwill, Customer Relationships and Other Intangible Assets 

Goodwill, customer relationships and other intangible assets consisted of the following: 

March 31, 2023 (1) 

December 31, 2022 (1) 

(Dollars in millions) Goodwill $ 12,657 &#160; 12,657 &#160; Indefinite-lived intangible assets $ 9 &#160; 9 &#160; Other intangible assets subject to amortization: &#160; Customer relationships, less accumulated amortization of $ 3,771 and $ 3,606 

4,409 &#160; 4,574 &#160; Capitalized software, less accumulated amortization of $ 3,801 and $ 3,895 (2) 

1,519 &#160; 1,482 &#160; Trade names, patents and other, less accumulated amortization of $ 61 and $ 188 (2) 

97 &#160; 101 &#160; Total other intangible assets, net $ 6,034 &#160; 6,166 &#160; 

______________________________________________________________________ 

(1) &#160; These values exclude assets classified as held for sale. 

(2) Certain capitalized software with a gross carrying value of $ 183 million and trade names with a gross carrying value of $ 130 million became fully amortized during 2022 and were retired during the three months ended March 31, 2023. 

As of March 31, 2023, the gross carrying amount of goodwill, customer relationships, indefinite-lived and other intangible assets was $ 26.3 billion. 

Our goodwill was derived from numerous acquisitions where the purchase price exceeded the fair value of the net assets acquired. We report our results within two segments: Business and Mass Markets. See Note 11&#8212;Segment Information for more information on these segments. The amount of goodwill assigned to our Business segment as of both March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 was $ 7.9 billion. The amount of goodwill assigned to our Mass Markets segment as of both March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 was $ 4.8 billion. Total goodwill as of both March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 was net of accumulated impairment losses of $ 11.0 billion. 

We are required to assess our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually, or, under certain circumstances, more frequently, such as when events or changes in circumstances indicate there may be impairment. We are required to write down the value of goodwill only when our assessment determines the carrying value of equity of any of our reporting units exceeds its fair value. Our annual impairment assessment date for goodwill is October 31, at which date we assess our reporting units. Our annual impairment assessment date for indefinite-lived intangible assets other than goodwill is December 31. 

As of March 31, 2023, we have three reporting units for goodwill impairment testing, which are (i) Mass Markets, (ii) North America Business and (iii) Asia Pacific region. Our reporting units are not discrete legal entities with discrete full financial statements. Our assets and liabilities are employed in and relate to the operations of multiple reporting units. For each reporting unit, we compare its estimated fair value of equity to its carrying value of equity that we assign to the reporting unit. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is greater than the carrying value, we conclude that no impairment exists. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, we record a non-cash impairment charge equal to the excess amount. Depending on the facts and circumstances, we typically estimate the fair value of our reporting units by considering either or both of (i) a discounted cash flow method, which is based on the present value of projected cash flows over a discrete projection period and a terminal value, which is based on the expected normalized cash flows of the reporting units following the discrete projection period, and (ii) a market approach, which includes the use of market multiples of publicly-traded companies whose services are comparable to ours . 

Total amortization expense for finite-lived intangible assets for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022 totaled $ 260 million and $ 274 million, respectively. 

We estimate that total amortization expense for finite-lived intangible assets for the years ending December 31, 2023 through 2027 will be as provided in the table below. As a result of classifying our EMEA business as held for sale on our March 31, 2023 consolidated balance sheet, the amounts presented below do not include future amortization expense for intangible assets of the business to be divested. See Note 2&#8212;Planned Divestiture of the EMEA Business for more information. 

&#160; (Dollars in millions) 2023 (remaining nine months) $ 720 &#160; 2024 891 &#160; 2025 832 &#160; 2026 787 &#160; 2027 704 &#160; 

(4) Revenue Recognition 

Product and Service Categories 

We categorize our products and services revenue among the following categories for the Business segment: 

&#8226; Grow , which includes products and services that we anticipate will grow, including our dark fiber, Edge Cloud services, IP, managed security, software-defined wide area networks (""SD WAN""), secure access service edge (""SASE""), Unified Communications and Collaboration (""UC&#38;C"") and wavelengths services;

&#8226; Voice and Other, under which we derive revenues from (i) providing local and long-distance services, professional services, and other ancillary services, and (ii) federal broadband and state support payments. 

Reconciliation of Total Revenue to Revenue from Contracts with Customers 

The following table provides total revenue by segment, sales channel and product category. It also provides the amount of revenue that is not subject to ASC 606, "" Revenue from Contracts with Customers "" (""ASC 606""), but is instead governed by other accounting standards. The amounts in the table below include revenue for the Latin American and ILEC businesses prior to their sales on August 1, 2022 and October 3, 2022, respectively. See Note 2&#8212;Divestitures of the Latin American and ILEC Businesses and Planned Divestiture of the EMEA Business in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 for additional information on these divestitures.

(1) Includes regulatory revenue and lease revenue not within the scope of ASC 606. 

Operating Lease Income 

Lumen Technologies leases various dark fiber, office facilities, colocation facilities, switching facilities, other network sites and service equipment to third parties under operating leases. Lease and sublease income are included in operating revenue in our consolidated statements of operations. 

For the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, our gross rental income was $ 269 million and $ 337 million, respectively, which represents approximately 7 % of our operating revenue for both the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022. 

Customer Receivables and Contract Balances 

The following table provides balances of customer receivables, contract assets and contract liabilities, net of amounts classified as held for sale, as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022: 

March 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 &#160; (Dollars in millions) 

Customer receivables (1)

Contract liabilities (3) 

675 &#160; 656 &#160; 

______________________________________________________________________ 

(1) Reflects gross customer receivables of $ 1.4 billion and $ 1.5 billion, net of allowance for credit losses of $ 72 million and $ 73 million, at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. These amounts exclude customer receivables, net, classified as held for sale of $ 85 million at March 31, 2023 and $ 76 million at December 31, 2022 related to the EMEA business. 

(2) These amounts exclude contract assets classified as held for sale of $ 13 million at March 31, 2023 and $ 16 million at December 31, 2022 related to the EMEA business. 

(3) These amounts exclude contract liabilities classified as held for sale of $ 57 million at March 31, 2023 and $ 59 million at December 31, 2022 related to the EMEA business. 

Contract liabilities are consideration we have received from our customers or billed in advance of providing goods or services promised in the future. We defer recognizing this consideration as revenue until we have satisfied the related performance obligation to the customer. Contract liabilities include recurring services billed one month in advance and installation and maintenance charges that are deferred and recognized over the actual or expected contract term, which typically ranges from one to five years depending on the service. Contract liabilities are included within deferred revenue on our consolidated balance sheets. During the three months ended March 31, 2023, we recognized $ 305 million of revenue that was included in contract liabilities of $ 715 million as of January 1, 2023, including contract liabilities that were classified as held for sale. During the three months ended March 31, 2022, we recognized $ 395 million of revenue that was included in contract liabilities of $ 841 million as of January 1, 2022, including contract liabilities that were classified as held for sale. 

Performance Obligations 

As of March 31, 2023, we expect to recognize approximately $ 7.8 billion of revenue in the future related to performance obligations associated with existing customer contracts that are partially or wholly unsatisfied. As of March 31, 2023, the transaction price related to unsatisfied performance obligations that are expected to be recognized for the remainder of 2023, 2024 and thereafter was $ 2.4 billion, $ 1.9 billion and $ 3.5 billion, respectively. 

These amounts exclude (i) the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts for which we recognize revenue at the amount to which we have the right to invoice for services performed (for example, uncommitted usage or non-recurring charges associated with professional or technical services to be completed), (ii) contracts that are classified as leasing arrangements or government assistance that are not subject to ASC 606, and (iii) the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts which relate to our planned divestiture of the EMEA business. 

Contract Costs 

The following table provides changes in our contract acquisition costs and fulfillment costs: 

Three Months Ended March 31, 2023 Three Months Ended March 31, 2022 Acquisition Costs Fulfillment Costs Acquisition Costs Fulfillment Costs (Dollars in millions) (Dollars in millions) 

Beginning of period balance (1)(2)

End of period balance (3)(4) 

$ 192 &#160; 182 &#160; 215 &#160; 187 &#160; 

______________________________________________________________________ 

(1) Beginning of period balance for the three months ended March 31, 2023 excludes $ 6 million of acquisition costs and no fulfillment costs classified as held for sale related to the EMEA business. 

(2) Beginning of period balance for the three months ended March 31, 2022 excludes acquisition costs and fulfillment costs classified as held for sale of $ 34 million and $ 32 million, respectively (related to both the Latin American business and the ILEC business). 

(3) End of period balance for the three months ended March 31, 2023 excludes $ 11 million of acquisition costs and $ 15 million fulfillment costs classified as held for sale related to the EMEA business. 

(4) End of period balance for the three months ended March 31, 2022 excludes acquisition costs and fulfillment costs classified as held for sale of $ 32 million and $ 32 million, respectively (related to both the Latin American business and the ILEC business). 

Acquisition costs include commission fees paid to employees as a result of obtaining contracts. Fulfillment costs include third party and internal costs associated with the provision, installation and activation of services to customers, including labor and materials consumed for these activities. 

Deferred acquisition and fulfillment costs are amortized based on the transfer of services on a straight-line basis over the average contract life of approximately 36 months for mass markets customers and 33 months for business customers. Amortized fulfillment costs are included in cost of services and products and amortized acquisition costs are included in selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations. The amount of these deferred costs that are anticipated to be amortized in the next 12 months are included in other current assets on our consolidated balance sheets. The amount of deferred costs expected to be amortized beyond the next twelve months is included in other noncurrent assets on our consolidated balance sheets. Deferred acquisition and fulfillment costs are assessed for impairment on a quarterly basis. 

(5) Credit Losses on Financial Instruments 

To assess our expected credit losses on financial instruments, we aggregate financial assets with similar risk characteristics to monitor their credit quality or deterioration over the life of such assets. We periodically monitor certain risk characteristics within our aggregated financial assets and revise their composition accordingly, to the extent internal and external risk factors change. We separately evaluate financial assets that do not share risk characteristics with other financial assets. Our financial assets measured at amortized cost primarily consist of accounts receivable. 

We use a loss rate method to estimate our allowance for credit losses. Our determination of the current expected credit loss rate begins with our review of historical loss experience as a percentage of accounts receivable. We measure our historical loss period based on the average days to recognize accounts receivable as credit losses. When asset specific characteristics and current conditions change from those in the historical period, due to changes in our credit and collections strategy, certain classes of aged balances, or credit loss and recovery policies, we perform a qualitative and quantitative assessment to adjust our historical loss rate. We use regression analysis to develop an expected loss rate using historical experience and economic data over a forecast period. We measure our forecast period based on the average days to collect payment on billed accounts receivable. To determine our current allowance for credit losses, we combine the historical and expected credit loss rates and apply them to our period end accounts receivable. 

If there is an unexpected deterioration of a customer's financial condition or an unexpected change in economic conditions, including macroeconomic events, we assess the need to adjust the allowance for credit losses. Any such resulting adjustments would affect earnings in the period that adjustments are made. 

The assessment of the correlation between historical observed default rates, current conditions and forecasted economic conditions requires judgment. Alternative interpretations of these factors could have resulted in different conclusions regarding our allowance for credit losses. The amount of credit loss is sensitive to changes in circumstances and forecasted economic conditions. Our historical credit loss experience, current conditions and forecast of economic conditions may also not be representative of the customers' actual default experience in the future, and we may use methodologies that differ from those used by other companies. 

The following table presents the activity of our allowance for credit losses by accounts receivable portfolio for the three months ended March 31, 2023:

Long-Term Debt Maturities 

Set forth below is the aggregate principal amount of our long-term debt as of March 31, 2023 (excluding unamortized discounts, net, and unamortized debt issuance costs), maturing during the following years. As a result of classifying our EMEA business as held for sale on our March 31, 2023 consolidated balance sheet, the amounts presented below do not include maturities of the finance lease obligations of that business. See Note 2&#8212;Planned Divestiture of the EMEA Business. 

&#160; (Dollars in millions) 2023 (remaining nine months) $ 115 &#160; 2024 157 &#160; 2025 1,665 &#160; 2026 498 &#160; 2027 9,386 &#160; 2028 and thereafter 8,240 &#160; Total long-term debt $ 20,061 &#160; 

Borrowings and Repayments 

Pursuant to exchange offers that commenced on March 16, 2023 (the &#8220;Exchange Offers&#8221;), on March 31, 2023, Level 3 Financing, Inc. issued $ 915 million of its 10.500 % Senior Secured Notes due 2030 (the &#8220; 10.500 % Notes&#8221;) in exchange for $ 1.535 billion of Lumen&#8217;s outstanding senior unsecured notes, which were concurrently cancelled. These transactions resulted in a net reduction in the aggregate principal amount of Lumen&#8217;s consolidated indebtedness of approximately $ 620 million. In addition, we repurchased $ 24 million of Lumen's outstanding senior unsecured notes during the first quarter of 2023. These above-described transactions resulted in an aggregate gain of $ 609 million. 

The following table sets forth the aggregate principal amount of each series of Lumen&#8217;s senior unsecured notes exchanged and retired on March 31, 2023:

Level 3 Financing, Inc.&#8217;s obligations under the 10.500 % Notes will be guaranteed on a secured basis by its direct parent, Level 3 Parent, LLC, and certain of its material domestic subsidiaries that guarantee the term loan under Level 3 Financing, Inc.&#8217;s existing senior secured credit facility and existing senior secured notes (the &#8220;Issuer&#8217;s Secured Debt&#8221;), subject in certain instances to receipt of regulatory approvals. Such guarantees, when provided by each entity, will be secured by liens on substantially the same collateral that is pledged to secure the Issuer&#8217;s Secured Debt. 

Covenants 

Certain of our debt instruments contain affirmative and negative covenants. Debt at Lumen Technologies, Inc. and Level 3 Financing, Inc. contains more extensive covenants including, among other things and subject to certain exceptions, restrictions on the ability to declare or pay dividends, repay certain other indebtedness, create liens, incur additional indebtedness, make investments, engage in transactions with affiliates, dispose of assets and merge or consolidate with any other person. Also, Lumen Technologies, Inc. and certain of its affiliates will be required to offer to purchase certain of their respective outstanding debt under defined circumstances in connection with specified ""change of control"" transactions. 

Certain of our debt instruments contain cross-payment default or cross-acceleration provisions. 

Compliance 

As of March 31, 2023, Lumen Technologies, Inc. believes it and its subsidiaries were in compliance with the provisions and financial covenants in their respective material debt agreements in all material respects. 

Subsequent Event - Issuance of Senior Secured Notes 

On April 17, 2023, in connection with the Exchange Offers, Level 3 Financing, Inc. issued an additional $ 9 million of its 10.500 % Notes in exchange for $ 19 million aggregate principal amount of Lumen&#8217;s senior unsecured notes. 

(7) Severance 

Periodically, we reduce our workforce and accrue liabilities for the related severance costs. These workforce reductions result primarily from the progression or completion of our post-acquisition integration plans, increased competitive pressures, cost reduction initiatives, process improvements through automation and reduced workloads due to reduced demand for certain services. 

Changes in our accrued liabilities for severance expenses were as follows: 

Severance &#160; (Dollars in millions) Balance at December 31, 2022 $ 11 &#160; Accrued to expense 8 &#160; Payments, net ( 5 ) Balance at March 31, 2023 $ 14 &#160; 

(8) Employee Benefits 

For detailed description of the various defined benefit pension plans (qualified and non-qualified), post-retirement benefits plans and defined contribution plan we sponsor, see Note 11&#8212;Employee Benefits to the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in Part II, Item 8 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. 

Net periodic benefit expense (income) for the Lumen Combined Pension Plan (the ""Combined Pension Plan"" or the ""Plan"") includes the following components: 

Combined Pension Plan &#160; Three Months Ended March 31, 2023 2022 (1) 

&#160; (Dollars in millions) Service cost $ 6 &#160; 12 &#160; Interest cost 68 &#160; 52 &#160; Expected return on plan assets ( 71 ) ( 100 ) Recognition of prior service credit ( 2 ) ( 3 ) Recognition of actuarial loss 25 &#160; 37 &#160; Net periodic pension expense (income) $ 26 &#160; ( 2 ) 

______________________________________________________________________ 

(1) These amounts include pension costs related to the Lumen Pension Plan prior to the sale of the ILEC business on October 3, 2022. For additional information on the Lumen Pension Plan, see Note 11&#8212;Employee Benefits to the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in Part II, Item 8 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. 

Net periodic benefit expense for our post-retirement benefit plans includes the following components: 

&#160; Post-Retirement Benefit Plans &#160; Three Months Ended March 31, &#160; 2023 2022 &#160; (Dollars in millions) Service cost $ 1 &#160; 3 &#160; Interest cost 26 &#160; 15 &#160; Recognition of prior service cost ( 2 ) 2 &#160; Recognition of actuarial loss ( 5 ) &#8212; &#160; Net periodic post-retirement benefit expense $ 20 &#160; 20 &#160; 

Service costs for our pension plans and post-retirement benefit plans are included in the cost of services and products and selling, general and administrative line items on our consolidated statements of operations and all other costs listed above are included in other (expense) income, net on our consolidated statements of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022. 

Our Combined Pension Plan contains provisions that allow us, from time to time, to offer lump sum payment options to certain former employees in settlement of their future retirement benefits. We record an accounting settlement charge, consisting of the recognition of certain deferred costs of the pension plan associated with these lump sum payments only if, in the aggregate, they exceed or are probable to exceed the sum of the annual service and interest costs for the plan&#8217;s net periodic pension benefit cost, which represents the settlement accounting threshold. The amount of any future non-cash settlement charges will be dependent on several factors, including the total amount of our future lump sum benefit payments. 

Benefits paid by the Combined Pension Plan are paid through a trust that holds the Plan's assets. The amount of required contributions to the Combined Pension Plan in 2023 and beyond will depend on a variety of factors, most of which are beyond our control, including earnings on plan investments, prevailing interest rates, demographic experience, changes in plan benefits and changes in funding laws and regulations. Based on current laws and circumstances, we do not believe we are required to make any additional contributions and we do not expect to make voluntary contributions to the trust for the Combined Pension Plan in 2023. 

(9) Earnings Per Common Share 

Basic and diluted earnings per common share for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022 were calculated as follows: 

&#160; Three Months Ended March 31, &#160; 2023 2022 &#160; (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts, shares in thousands) Income (numerator) Net income $ 511 &#160; 599 &#160; Net income applicable to common stock for computing basic earnings per common share 511 &#160; 599 &#160; Net income as adjusted for purposes of computing diluted earnings per common share $ 511 &#160; 599 &#160; Shares (denominator): Weighted-average number of shares: Outstanding during period 1,003,666 &#160; 1,027,217 &#160; Non-vested restricted stock ( 22,111 ) ( 18,787 ) Weighted average shares outstanding for computing basic earnings per common share 981,555 &#160; 1,008,430 &#160; Incremental common shares attributable to dilutive securities: Shares issuable under convertible securities 10 &#160; 10 &#160; Shares issuable under incentive compensation plans 718 &#160; 6,775 &#160; Number of shares as adjusted for purposes of computing diluted earnings per common share 982,283 &#160; 1,015,215 &#160; Basic earnings per common share $ 0.52 &#160; 0.59 &#160; 

Diluted earnings per common share 

$ 0.52 &#160; 0.59 &#160; 

Our calculation of diluted earnings per common share excludes unvested restricted stock awards that are antidilutive as a result of unrecognized compensation cost. Such shares were 21.2 million and 8.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 

(10) Fair Value of Financial Instruments 

Our financial instruments consist of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, long-term debt (excluding finance lease and other obligations), interest rate swap contracts, certain equity investments and certain indemnification obligations. Due primarily to their short-term nature, the carrying amounts of our cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate their fair values. 

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between independent and knowledgeable parties who are willing and able to transact for an asset or liability at the measurement date. We use valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when determining fair value and then we rank the estimated values based on the reliability of the inputs used following the fair value hierarchy. 

We determined the fair values of our long-term debt, including the current portion, based on quoted market prices where available or, if not available, based on inputs other than quoted market prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable such as discounted future cash flows using current market interest rates. 

The three input levels in the hierarchy of fair value measurements are defined by the FASB generally as follows: 

Input Level Description of Input Level 1 Observable inputs such as quoted market prices in active markets. Level 2 Inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable. Level 3 Unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists. 

The following table presents the carrying amounts and estimated fair values of our financial assets and liabilities as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022: 

&#160; &#160; March 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 &#160; Input Level Carrying Amount Fair Value Carrying Amount Fair Value &#160; (Dollars in millions)

Investment Held at Net Asset Value 

We hold an investment in a limited partnership created as a holding company for various investments, including a portion of the colocation and data center business that we divested in 2017. The limited partnership has sole discretion as to the amount and timing of distributions of the underlying assets. As of March 31, 2023, the underlying investments held by the limited partnership are traded in active markets and as such, we account for our investment in the limited partnership using net asset value (""NAV""). Subject to restrictions imposed by law and other provisions of the limited partnership agreement, the general partner has the sole discretion as to the amounts and timing of distributions of partnership assets to partners. The following table summarizes the net asset value of our investment in this limited partnership.

(1) For the three months ended March 31, 2023, we recognized $ 61 million of loss on investment, reflected in other (expense) income, net in our consolidated statements of operations. For the three months ended March 31, 2022, we recognized $ 66 million of gain on investment, reflected in other (expense) income, net in our consolidated statements of operations. 

(11) Segment Information 

We report our results within two segments: Business and Mass Markets. 

Under our Business segment we provide products and services to meet the needs of our enterprise and wholesale customers under four distinct sales channels: Large Enterprise, Mid-Market Enterprise, Public Sector and Wholesale. For Business segment revenue, we report the following product categories: Grow, Nurture, Harvest and Other, in each case through the sales channels outlined above. The Business segment included the results of our Latin American and ILEC businesses prior to their sales on August 1, 2022 and October 3, 2022, respectively. 

Under our Mass Markets Segment, we provide products and services to residential and small business customers. We report the following categories: Fiber Broadband, Other Broadband and Voice and Other. The Mass Markets segment included the results of our ILEC business prior to its sale on October 3, 2022. 

See detailed descriptions of these product and service categories in Note 4&#8212;Revenue Recognition. 

As described in more detail below, our segments are managed based on the direct costs of providing services to their customers and directly associated selling, general and administrative costs (primarily salaries and commissions). Shared costs are managed separately and included in ""other unallocated amounts"" in the table below. As referenced above, we reclassified certain prior period amounts to conform to the current period presentation. See Note 1&#8212; Background for additional detail on these changes. 

The following tables summarize our segment results for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, based on the segment categorization we were operating under at March 31, 2023. 

Three Months Ended March 31, 2023 Business Mass Markets (Dollars in millions) Segment revenue $ 2,956 &#160; 782 &#160; Segment expenses: Cost of services and products 801 &#160; 25 &#160; Selling, general and administrative 290 &#160; 325 &#160; Total segment expense 1,091 &#160; 350 &#160; Total segment adjusted EBITDA $ 1,865 &#160; 432 &#160;

&#160; Three Months Ended March 31, &#160; 2023 2022 &#160; (Dollars in millions) Business segment adjusted EBITDA $ 1,865 &#160; 2,267 &#160; Mass Markets segment adjusted EBITDA 432 &#160; 848 &#160; Other unallocated amounts ( 1,160 ) ( 1,201 ) Total Adjusted EBITDA $ 1,137 &#160; 1,914 &#160; 

Revenue and Expenses 

Our segment revenue includes all revenue from our two segments as described in more detail above. Our segment revenue is based upon each customer's classification. We report our segment revenue based upon all services provided to that segment's customers. Our segment expenses include specific cost of service expenses incurred as a direct result of providing services and products to segment customers, along with selling, general and administrative expenses that are directly associated with specific segment customers or activities. We have not allocated assets or debt to specific segments. 

The following items are excluded from our segment results, because they are centrally managed and not monitored by or reported to our chief operating decision maker by segment: 

&#8226; network expenses not incurred as a direct result of providing services and products to segment customers and centrally managed expenses such as Finance, Human Resources, Legal, Marketing, Product Management and IT, all of which are reported as ""other unallocated amounts"" in the table above; 

&#8226; depreciation and amortization expense; 

&#8226; goodwill or other impairments; 

&#8226; interest expense; 

&#8226; stock-based compensation; and 

&#8226; other income and expense items. 

The following table reconciles total adjusted EBITDA to net income for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022: 

&#160; Three Months Ended March 31, &#160; 2023 2022 &#160; (Dollars in millions) Net income $ 511 &#160; 599 &#160; Income tax expense 169 &#160; 202 &#160; Total other (income) expense, net ( 290 ) 282 &#160; Depreciation and amortization 733 &#160; 808 &#160; Stock-based compensation 14 &#160; 23 &#160; Total Adjusted EBITDA $ 1,137 &#160; 1,914 &#160; 

(12) Commitments, Contingencies and Other Items 

We are subject to various claims, legal proceedings and other contingent liabilities, including the matters described below, which individually or in the aggregate could materially affect our financial condition, future results of operations or cash flows. As a matter of course, we are prepared to both litigate these matters to judgment as needed, as well as to evaluate and consider reasonable settlement opportunities. 

We review our litigation accrual liabilities on a quarterly basis, but in accordance with applicable accounting guidelines only establish accrual liabilities when losses are deemed probable and reasonably estimable and only revise previously established accrual liabilities when warranted by changes in circumstances, in each case based on then-available information. As such, as of any given date we could have exposure to losses under proceedings as to which no liability has been accrued or as to which the accrued liability is inadequate. Subject to these limitations, at March 31, 2023, we had accrued $ 86 million in the aggregate for our litigation and non-income tax contingencies, which is included in other current liabilities, other liabilities, or liabilities held for sale on our consolidated balance sheet as of such date. We cannot at this time estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of loss in excess of this $ 86 million accrual due to the inherent uncertainties and speculative nature of contested proceedings. The establishment of an accrual does not mean that actual funds have been set aside to satisfy a given contingency. Thus, the resolution of a particular contingency for the amount accrued could have no effect on our results of operations but nonetheless could have an adverse effect on our cash flows. 

In this Note, when we refer to a class action as ""putative"" it is because a class has been alleged, but not certified, in that matter. 

Principal Proceedings 

Shareholder Class Action Suits 

Lumen and certain Lumen Board of Directors members and officers were named as defendants in a putative shareholder class action lawsuit filed on June 12, 2018 in the Boulder County District Court of the state of Colorado, captioned Houser et al. v. CenturyLink, et al. The complaint asserted claims on behalf of a putative class of former Level 3 shareholders who became CenturyLink, Inc. shareholders as a result of our acquisition of Level 3. It alleged that the proxy statement provided to the Level 3 shareholders failed to disclose various material information of several kinds, including information about strategic revenue, customer loss rates, and customer account issues, among other items. The complaint seeks damages, costs and fees, rescission, rescissory damages, and other equitable relief. In May 2020, the court dismissed the complaint. Plaintiffs appealed that decision, and in March 2022, the appellate court affirmed the district court's order in part and reversed it in part. It then remanded the case to the district court for further proceedings. 

On March 3, 2023, a purported shareholder of Lumen filed a putative class action complaint captioned Voigt v. Lumen Technologies, Inc., et al., Case 3:23-cv-00286-TAD-KDM, in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Louisiana. The complaint alleges that Lumen and certain of its current or former officers violated the federal securities laws by omitting or misstating material information related to Lumen&#8217;s expansion of its Quantum Fiber business. The complaint seeks money damages, attorneys&#8217; fees and costs, and other relief. 

State Tax Suits 

Since 2012, a number of Missouri municipalities have asserted claims in the Circuit Court of St. Louis County, Missouri, alleging that we and several of our subsidiaries have underpaid taxes. These municipalities are seeking, among other things, declaratory relief regarding the application of business license and gross receipts taxes and back taxes from 2007 to the present, plus penalties and interest. In a February 2017 ruling in connection with one of these pending cases, the court entered an order awarding the plaintiffs $ 4 million and broadening the tax base on a going-forward basis. We appealed that decision to the Missouri Supreme Court. In December 2019, it affirmed the circuit court's order in some respects and reversed it in others, remanding the case to the circuit court for further proceedings. The Missouri Supreme Court's decision reduced our exposure in the case. In a June 2021 ruling in one of the pending cases, another trial court awarded the cities of Columbia and Joplin approximately $ 55 million, plus statutory interest. On appeal, the Missouri Court of Appeals affirmed in part and reversed in part, vacated the judgment and remanded the case to the trial court with instructions for further proceedings consistent with the Missouri Supreme Court's decision. We continue to vigorously defend against these claims. 

Billing Practices Suits 

In June 2017, a former employee filed an employment lawsuit against us claiming that she was wrongfully terminated for alleging that we charged some of our retail customers for products and services they did not authorize. Thereafter, based in part on the allegations made by the former employee, several legal proceedings were filed, including consumer class actions in federal and state courts, a series of securities investor class actions in federal courts and several shareholder derivative actions in federal and Louisiana state courts. The derivative cases were brought on behalf of CenturyLink, Inc. against certain current and former officers and directors of the Company and seek damages for alleged breaches of fiduciary duties. 

The consumer class actions, the securities investor class actions, and the federal derivative actions were transferred to the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota for coordinated and consolidated pretrial proceedings as In Re: CenturyLink Sales Practices and Securities Litigation. We have settled the consumer and securities investor class actions. Those settlements are final. The derivative actions remain pending. 

We have engaged in discussions regarding related claims with a number of state attorneys general, and have entered into agreements settling certain of the consumer practices claims asserted by state attorneys general. While we do not agree with allegations raised in these matters, we have been willing to consider reasonable settlements where appropriate. 

December 2018 Outage Proceedings 

We experienced an outage on one of our transport networks that impacted voice, IP, 911, and transport services for some of our customers between the 27th and 29th of December 2018. We believe that the outage was caused by a faulty network management card from a third-party equipment vendor. 

The FCC and four states (both Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission (""WUTC"") and the Washington Attorney General; the Montana Public Service Commission; the Nebraska Public Service Commission; and the Wyoming Public Service Commission) initiated formal investigations. In November 2020, following the FCC's release of a public report on the outage, we negotiated a settlement which was released by the FCC in December 2020. The amount of the settlement was not material to our financial statements. 

In December 2020, the Staff of the WUTC filed a complaint against us based on the December 2018 outage, seeking penalties owed for alleged violations of Washington regulations and laws. The matter was tried before the WUTC in December 2022 and we await a decision by the WUTC. 

AT&#38;T Proceedings 

In August 2022, certain of our subsidiaries filed a complaint in federal district court in Colorado captioned Central Telephone Company of Virginia, et al, v. AT&#38;T Corp., et al. The suit seeks relief and damages for AT&#38;T&#8217;s failure to pay amounts for services it receives. AT&#38;T disputes those claims and has asserted counterclaims alleging breach of contract and seeking declaratory relief. It has requested the court to enjoin the plaintiffs from terminating services for failure to pay, and it has requested the court transfer the case to federal court in the southern district of New York for further proceedings. Also in August 2022, AT&#38;T filed a separate lawsuit in federal court in the western district of Louisiana against Central Telephone Company of Virginia and other of our subsidiaries alleging, among other claims, breach of contract provisions pertaining to network architecture. The Lumen plaintiff entities dispute AT&#38;T&#8217;s claims. 

Latin American Tax Litigation and Claims 

In connection with the recent divestiture of our Latin American business, the purchaser assumed responsibility for the Peruvian tax litigation and Brazilian tax claims described in our prior periodic reports filed with the SEC. We have agreed to indemnify the purchaser for amounts paid in respect of the Brazilian tax claims. The value of this indemnification is included in the indemnification amount as disclosed in Note 10&#8212;Fair Value of Financial Instruments. 

Other Proceedings, Disputes and Contingencies 

From time to time, we are involved in other proceedings incidental to our business, including patent infringement allegations, regulatory hearings relating primarily to our rates or services, actions relating to employee claims, various tax issues, environmental law issues, grievance hearings before labor regulatory agencies and miscellaneous third-party tort actions or commercial disputes. 

We are currently defending several patent infringement lawsuits asserted against us by non-practicing entities, many of which are seeking substantial recoveries. These cases have progressed to various stages and one or more may go to trial within the next twelve months if they are not otherwise resolved. Where applicable, we are seeking full or partial indemnification from our vendors and suppliers. As with all litigation, we are vigorously defending these actions and, as a matter of course, are prepared to litigate these matters to judgment, as well as to evaluate and consider all reasonable settlement opportunities. 

We are subject to various foreign, federal, state and local environmental protection and health and safety laws. From time to time, we are subject to judicial and administrative proceedings brought by various governmental authorities under these laws. Several such proceedings are currently pending, but none is reasonably expected to exceed $ 300,000 in fines and penalties. 

The outcome of these other proceedings described under this heading is not predictable. However, based on current circumstances, we do not believe that the ultimate resolution of these other proceedings, after considering available defenses and any insurance coverage or indemnification rights, will have a material adverse effect on us. 

The matters listed in this Note do not reflect all of our contingencies. For additional information on our contingencies, see Note 18&#8212;Commitments, Contingencies and Other Items to the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in Part II, Item 8 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. The ultimate outcome of the above-described matters may differ materially from the outcomes anticipated, estimated, projected or implied by us in certain of our statements appearing above in this Note, and proceedings currently viewed as immaterial by us may ultimately materially impact us.

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

(Unaudited) 

Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

Basis of Presentation 

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated fi nancial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP) and applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding interim financial reporting. Certain information and note disclosures normally included in the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. As such, the information included in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. 

The condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022 included herein was derived from the audited financial statements as of that date, but does not include all disclosures including notes required by GAAP. 

The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Meta Platforms, Inc., its subsidiaries where we have controlling financial interests, and any variable interest entities for which we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. 

The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all normal recurring adjustments that are necessary to present fairly the results for the interim periods presented. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of the results for the full year ending December 31, 2023. 

Use of Estimates 

Preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts in the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates form the basis for judgments we make about the carrying values of our assets and liabilities, which are not readily apparent from other sources. We base our estimates and judgments on historical information and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments in several areas, including, but not limited to, those related to revenue recognition, valuation of non-marketable equity securities, income taxes, loss contingencies, including the ultimate resolution of litigation, regulatory matters, and asserted and unasserted claims, valuation of long-lived assets including goodwill, intangible assets, and property and equipment, and their associated estimated useful lives, valuation of purchase commitments, credit losses of available-for-sale debt securities and accounts receivable, fair value of financial instruments, and fair value of leases. These estimates are based on management's knowledge about current events, interpretation of regulations, and expectations about actions we may undertake in the future. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. 

Significant Accounting Policies 

There have been no material changes to our significant accounting policies from our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022.

Note 3. Restructuring 

2023 Restructuri ng 

In March 2023, we announced three rounds of planned layoffs to further reduce our company size by approximately 10,000 employees across the Family of Apps (FoA) and Reality Labs ( RL) segments (the &#8220;2023 Restructuring&#8221;). I mpacted employees in our recruiting and technology teams were notified in March 2023 and April 2023 , respectively. We expect to notify employees in our business groups and remaining technology teams in May 2023 . In certain regions, it may take through the end of 2023 or longer to complete these layoffs. In connection with these layoffs, we expect to incur total pre-tax severance and related personnel costs of approximately $ 1 billion across the FoA and RL segments. W e began recording these restructuring charges in the first quarter of 2023 and expect that the remaining charges will be substantially recognized by the end of 2023 in accordance with the Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 420, Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations . 

A summary of our 2023 Restructuring pre-tax charges recorded for severance and related personnel costs in the three months ended March 31, 2023 is as follows (in millions) :

(1) Total severance and related personnel costs i nclude $ 61 million of share-based compensation expense recognized for the 2023 layoffs. 

Total restructuring charges recorded under our FoA segment were $ 468 million and RL segment were $ 55 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023. 

The following is a summary of changes in the accrued severance and other personnel liabilities related to 2023 layoff activities, included within accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheets (in millions):

In 2022, we initiated several measures to pursue greater efficiency and to realign our business and strategic priorities. This includes a facilities consolidation strategy to sublease, early terminate, or abandon several office buildings under operating leases, a layoff of approximately 11,000 employees across the FoA and RL segments, and a pivot towards a next generation data center design, including cancellation of multiple data center projects (the &#8220;2022 Restructuring&#8221;). As of March 31, 2023, we have substantially completed the 2022 employee layoff while continuing to assess facilities consolidation and data center restructuring initiatives. The 2022 Restructuring charges recorded to date were $ 5.23 billion, with $ 4.56 billion in FoA and the remainder in RL.

The following is a summary of changes in the severance and other personnel liabilities related to the 2022 layoff activities, included within accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheets (in millions): 

Severance Liabilities Balance as of January 1, 2022 $ &#8212; &#160; Severance and other personnel costs 975 &#160; Cash payments ( 203 ) Balance as of December 31, 2022 772 &#160; Adjustments and foreign exchange ( 27 ) Cash payments ( 675 ) Balance as of March 31, 2023 $ 70 &#160; 

Note 4. Earnings per Share 

We compute earnings per share (EPS) of Class A and Class B common stock using the two-class method. As the liquidation and dividend rights for both Class A and Class B common stock are identical, the undistributed earnings are allocated on a proportionate basis to the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. 

Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of shares of our Class A and Class B common stock outstanding. For the calculation of diluted EPS, net income for basic EPS is adjusted by the effect of dilutive securities, including awards under our equity compensation plan. 

In addition, the computation of the diluted EPS of Class A common stock assumes the conversion of our Class B common stock to Class A common stock, while the diluted EPS of Class B common stock does not assume the conversion of those shares to Class A common stock. Diluted EPS is computed by dividing the resulting net income by the weighted-average number of fully diluted common shares outstanding. 

For the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, approximately 86 million and 48 million shares of Class A common stock equivalents of restricted stock units (RSUs), respectively, were excluded from the diluted EPS calculation as including them would have an anti-dilutive effect. 

Basic and diluted EPS are the same for each class of common stock because they are entitled to the same liquidation and dividend rights. 

The numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted EPS computations for our common stock are calculated as follows (in millions, except per share amounts): 

&#160; Three Months Ended March 31, &#160; 2023 2022 &#160; Class A Class B Class A Class B Basic EPS: Numerator Net income $ 4,905 &#160; $ 804 &#160; $ 6,334 &#160; $ 1,131 &#160; Denominator Shares used in computation of basic earnings per share 2,223 &#160; 364 &#160; 2,312 &#160; 413 &#160; Basic EPS $ 2.21 &#160; $ 2.21 &#160; $ 2.74 &#160; $ 2.74 &#160; Diluted EPS: Numerator Net income $ 4,905 &#160; $ 804 &#160; $ 6,334 &#160; $ 1,131 &#160; Reallocation of net income as a result of conversion of Class B to Class A common stock 804 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 1,131 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Reallocation of net income to Class B common stock &#8212; &#160; ( 3 ) &#8212; &#160; ( 7 ) Net income for diluted EPS $ 5,709 &#160; $ 801 &#160; $ 7,465 &#160; $ 1,124 &#160; Denominator Shares used in computation of basic earnings per share 2,223 &#160; 364 &#160; 2,312 &#160; 413 &#160; Conversion of Class B to Class A common stock 364 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 413 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Weighted-average effect of dilutive RSUs 9 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 17 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Shares used in computation of diluted earnings per share 2,596 &#160; 364 &#160; 2,742 &#160; 413 &#160; Diluted EPS $ 2.20 &#160; $ 2.20 &#160; $ 2.72 &#160; $ 2.72 &#160; 

Note 5. Financial Instruments 

We have cash deposits with financial institutions globally. As part of our cash management strategy, we concentrate cash deposits with large financial institutions subject to the strictest regulations and our marketable securities are held in diversified highly rated securities. 

Instruments Measured at Fair Value 

We classify our cash equivalents and marketable debt securities within Level 1 or Level 2 because we use quoted market prices or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing market observable inputs to determine their fair value. Our marketable equity securities are publicly traded stocks measured at fair value and classified within Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy because we use quoted prices for identical assets in active markets to estimate their fair value. Certain other assets are classified within Level 3 because factors used to develop the estimated fair value are unobservable inputs that are not supported by market activity. 

The following tables summarize our assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis and the classification by level of input within the fair value hierarchy (in millions):

Note 8. Leases 

We have entered into various non-cancelable operating lease agreements mostly for certain of our offices, data centers, colocations, and land. We have also entered into various non-cancelable finance lease agreements for certain network infrastructure. Our leases have original lease periods expiring between the remainder of 2023 and 2093. Many leases include one or more options to renew. We do not assume renewals in our determination of the lease term unless the renewals are deemed to be reasonably assured. Our lease agreements generally do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.

Note 9. Acquisitions, Goodwill, and Intangible Assets 

During the three months ended March 31, 2023, we completed a business acquisition with total purchase consideration of $ 430 million in cash. Substantially all of the total consideration was allocated to $ 88 million of intangible assets and $ 343 million of goodwill. Goodwill generated from the business acquisition completed was primarily attributable to expected synergies and potential monetization opportunities. The amount of goodwill generated that was deductible for tax purposes was not material. Acquisition-related costs were immaterial and were expensed as incurred. Pro forma historical results of operations related to this business acquisition have not been presented because they are not significant to our condensed consolidated financial statements. We have included the financial results of this acquired business in our condensed consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition.

Note 12. Commitments and Contingencies 

Contractual Commitments 

We have $ 17.48 billion of non-cancelable contractual commitments as of March 31, 2023, which are primarily related to our investments in network infrastructure, servers, and consumer hardware products in Reality Labs. The following is a schedule, by years, of non-cancelable contractual commitments as of March 31, 2023 (in millions): 

The remainder of 2023 $ 10,745 &#160; 2024 2,222 &#160; 2025 1,500 &#160; 2026 264 &#160; 2027 210 &#160; Thereafter 2,536 &#160; Total $ 17,477 &#160; 

Additionally, as part of the normal course of business, we have entered into multi-year agreements to purchase renewable energy that do not specify a fixed or minimum volume commitment or to purchase certain server components that do not specify a fixed or minimum price commitment. We enter into these agreements in order to secure either volume or price. Using the projected market prices or expected volume consumption, the total estimated spend as of March 31, 2023 is approximately $ 12.22 billion, a majority of which is due beyond five years . The ultimate spend under these agreements may vary and will be based on prevailing market prices or actual volume purchased. 

Legal and Related Matters 

With respect to the cases, actions, and inquiries described below, we evaluate the associated developments on a regular basis and accrue a liability when we believe a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. In addition, we believe there is a reasonable possibility that we may incur a loss in some of these matters. With respect to the matters 

described below that do not include an estimate of the amount of loss or range of possible loss, such losses or range of possible losses either cannot be estimated or are not individually material, but we believe there is a reasonable possibility that they may be material in the aggregate. 

We are also party to various other legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations that arise in the ordinary course of business. Additionally, we are required to comply with various legal and regulatory obligations around the world. The requirements for complying with these obligations may be uncertain and subject to interpretation and enforcement by regulatory and other authorities, and any failure to comply with such obligations could eventually lead to asserted legal or regulatory action. With respect to these other legal proceedings, claims, regulatory, tax, or government inquiries and investigations, and other matters, asserted and unasserted, we evaluate the associated developments on a regular basis and accrue a liability when we believe a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. In addition, we believe there is a reasonable possibility that we may incur a loss in some of these other matters. We believe that the amount of losses or any estimable range of possible losses with respect to these other matters will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business and condensed consolidated financial statements. 

The ultimate outcome of the legal and related matters described in this section, such as whether the likelihood of loss is remote, reasonably possible, or probable, or if and when the reasonably possible range of loss is estimable, is inherently uncertain. Therefore, if one or more of these matters were resolved against us for amounts in excess of management's estimates of loss, our results of operations and financial condition, including in a particular reporting period in which any such outcome becomes probable and estimable, could be materially adversely affected. 

For information regarding income tax contingencies, see Note 14 &#8212; Income Taxes. 

Privacy and Related Matters 

Beginning on March 20, 2018, multiple putative class actions were filed in state and federal courts in the United States and elsewhere against us and certain of our directors and officers alleging various causes of action in connection with our platform and user data practices as well as the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in violation of our terms and policies, and seeking unspecified damages and injunctive relief. With respect to the putative class actions alleging fraud and violations of consumer protection, privacy, and other laws in connection with the same matters, several of the cases brought on behalf of consumers in the United States were consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. On September 9, 2019, the court granted, in part, and denied, in part, our motion to dismiss the consolidated putative consumer class action. On December 22, 2022, the parties entered into a settlement agreement to resolve the lawsuit, which provides for a payment of $ 725 million by us and is subject to court approval. In addition, our platform and user data practices, as well as the events surrounding the misuse of certain data by a developer, became the subject of U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), state attorneys general, and other government inquiries in the United States, Europe, and other jurisdictions. We entered into a settlement and modified consent order to resolve the FTC inquiry, which took effect in April 2020. Among other matters, our settlement with the FTC required us to pay a penalty of $ 5.0 billion which was paid in April 2020 upon the effectiveness of the modified consent order. The state attorneys general inquiry and certain government inquiries in other jurisdictions remain ongoing. On July 16, 2021, a stockholder derivative action was filed in Delaware Chancery Court against certain of our directors and officers asserting breach of fiduciary duty and related claims relating to our historical platform and user data practices, as well as our settlement with the FTC. On July 20, 2021, other stockholders filed an amended derivative complaint in a related Delaware Chancery Court action, asserting breach of fiduciary duty and related claims against certain of our current and former directors and officers in connection with our historical platform and user data practices. On November 4, 2021, the lead plaintiffs filed a second amended and consolidated complaint in the stockholder derivative action. We believe the lawsuits described above are without merit, and we are vigorously defending them. 

We also notify the Irish Data Protection Commission (IDPC), our lead European Union privacy regulator under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), of certain other personal data breaches and privacy issues, and are subject to inquiries and investigations by the IDPC and other European regulators regarding various aspects of our regulatory compliance. For example, we are currently subject to an IDPC inquiry regarding Meta Platforms Ireland's ability to transfer European Economic Area Facebook user data to the United States, which is described further in ""Legal Proceedings"" contained in Part II, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The interpretation of the GDPR is still evolving and draft decisions in investigations by the IDPC are subject to review by other European privacy regulators as part of the GDPR's 

cooperation and consistency mechanisms, which may lead to significant changes in the final outcome of such investigations. As a result, the interpretation and enforcement of the GDPR, as well as the imposition and amount of penalties for non-compliance, are subject to significant uncertainty. Although we are vigorously defending our regulatory compliance, we have accrued significant amounts for loss contingencies related to these inquiries and investigations in Europe, and we believe there is a reasonable possibility that additional accruals for losses related to these matters could be material individually or in the aggregate. 

On February 14, 2022, the State of Texas filed a lawsuit against us in Texas state court alleging that ""tag suggestions"" and other uses of facial recognition technology violated the Texas Capture or Use of Biometric Identifiers Act and the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices-Consumer Protection Act, and seeking statutory damages and injunctive relief. The case is currently scheduled for trial in January 2024. We believe this lawsuit is without merit, and we are vigorously defending it. 

Beginning on June 7, 2021, multiple putative class actions were filed against us alleging that we improperly received individuals' information from third-party websites or apps via our business tools in violation of our terms and various state and federal laws and seeking unspecified damages and injunctive relief. We believe these lawsuits are without merit, and we are vigorously defending them. 

Competition 

We are subject to various litigation and government inquiries and investigations, formal or informal, by competition authorities in the United States, Europe, and other jurisdictions. Such investigations, inquiries, and lawsuits concern, among other things, our business practices in the areas of social networking or social media services, digital advertising, and/or mobile or online applications, as well as our acquisitions. For example, in June 2019 we were informed by the FTC that it had opened an antitrust investigation of our company. On December 9, 2020, the FTC filed a complaint against us in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia alleging that we engaged in anticompetitive conduct and unfair methods of competition in violation of Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act and Section 2 of the Sherman Act, including by acquiring Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014 and by maintaining conditions on access to our platform. In addition, beginning in the third quarter of 2019, we became the subject of antitrust investigations by the U.S. Department of Justice and state attorneys general. On December 9, 2020, the attorneys general from 46 states, the territory of Guam, and the District of Columbia filed a complaint against us in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia alleging that we engaged in anticompetitive conduct in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act, including by acquiring Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014 and by maintaining conditions on access to our platform. The complaint also alleged that we violated Section 7 of the Clayton Act by acquiring Instagram and WhatsApp. The complaints of the FTC and attorneys general both sought a permanent injunction against our company's alleged violations of the antitrust laws, and other equitable relief, including divestiture or reconstruction of Instagram and WhatsApp. On June 28, 2021, the court granted our motions to dismiss the complaints filed by the FTC and attorneys general, dismissing the FTC's complaint with leave to amend and dismissing the attorneys general's case without prejudice. On July 28, 2021, the attorneys general filed a notice of appeal of the order dismissing their case and that appeal is now pending before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. On August 19, 2021, the FTC filed an amended complaint, and on October 4, 2021, we filed a motion to dismiss this amended complaint. On January 11, 2022, the court denied our motion to dismiss the FTC's amended complaint. Multiple putative class actions have also been filed in state and federal courts in the United States and in the United Kingdom against us alleging violations of antitrust laws and other causes of action in connection with these acquisitions and/or other alleged anticompetitive conduct, and seeking damages and injunctive relief. Several of the cases brought on behalf of certain advertisers and users in the United States were consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. On January 14, 2022, the court granted, in part, and denied, in part, our motion to dismiss the consolidated actions. On March 1, 2022, a first amended consolidated complaint was filed in the putative class action brought on behalf of certain advertisers. On December 6, 2022, the court denied our motion to dismiss the first amended consolidated complaint filed in the putative class action brought on behalf of certain advertisers. We believe these lawsuits are without merit, and we are vigorously defending them. In December 2022, the European Commission issued a Statement of Objections alleging that we tie Facebook Marketplace to Facebook and use data in a manner that infringes European Union competition rules. 

Securities and Other Actions 

Beginning on March 20, 2018, multiple putative class actions and derivative actions were filed in state and federal courts in the United States and elsewhere against us and certain of our directors and officers alleging violations of securities 

laws, breach of fiduciary duties, and other causes of action in connection with our platform and user data practices as well as the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in violation of our terms and policies, and seeking unspecified damages and injunctive relief. Beginning on July 27, 2018, two putative class actions were filed in federal court in the United States against us and certain of our directors and officers alleging violations of securities laws in connection with the disclosure of our earnings results for the second quarter of 2018 and seeking unspecified damages. These two actions subsequently were transferred and consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California with the putative securities class action described above relating to our platform and user data practices. In a series of orders in 2019 and 2020, the district court granted our motions to dismiss the plaintiffs' claims. On January 17, 2022, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal of the order dismissing their case, and the appeal is now pending before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. We believe the lawsuits described above are without merit, and we are vigorously defending them. 

Beginning on August 15, 2018, multiple putative class actions were filed against us alleging that we inflated our estimates of the potential audience size for advertisements, resulting in artificially increased demand and higher prices. The cases were consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California and seek unspecified damages and injunctive relief. In a series of rulings in 2019, 2021, and 2022, the court dismissed certain of the plaintiffs' claims, but permitted their fraud and unfair competition claims to proceed. On March 29, 2022, the court granted the plaintiffs' motion for class certification. On June 21, 2022, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit granted our petition for permission to appeal the district court's class certification order, and the district court subsequently stayed the case. We believe this lawsuit is without merit, and we are vigorously defending it. 

We are also subject to other government inquiries and investigations relating to our business activities and disclosure practices. For example, beginning in September 2021, we became subject to government investigations and requests relating to a former employee's allegations and release of internal company documents concerning, among other things, our algorithms, advertising and user metrics, and content enforcement practices, as well as misinformation and other undesirable activity on our platform, and user well-being. We have since received additional requests relating to these and other topics. Beginning on October 27, 2021, multiple putative class actions and derivative actions were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against us and certain of our directors and officers alleging violations of securities laws, breach of fiduciary duties, and other causes of action in connection with the same matters, and seeking unspecified damages. We believe these lawsuits are without merit, and we are vigorously defending them. 

Beginning in January 2022, we became subject to litigation and other proceedings that were filed in various federal and state courts alleging that Facebook and Instagram cause ""social media addiction"" in teenage users, resulting in various mental health and other harms. A putative class action was also filed in U.S. state court on behalf of users under the age of 13, several class actions have been filed in Canada on behalf of Canadian users, and multiple school districts and one state in the U.S. have filed public nuisance claims based on similar allegations. On October 6, 2022, the federal cases were consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. The California state court proceedings are now pending before a trial judge from Los Angeles County Superior Court. We believe these lawsuits are without merit, and we are vigorously defending them. We are also subject to government investigations and requests from multiple regulators concerning the use of our products, and the related mental and physical health and safety impacts on teenage users. 

On March 8, 2022, a putative class action was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against us and certain of our directors and officers alleging violations of securities laws in connection with the disclosure of our earnings results for the fourth quarter of 2021 and seeking unspecified damages. We believe this lawsuit is without merit, and we are vigorously defending it. 

In addition, we are subject to litigation and other proceedings involving law enforcement and other regulatory agencies, including in particular in Brazil, Russia, and other countries in Europe, in order to ascertain the precise scope of our legal obligations to comply with the requests of those agencies, including our obligation to disclose user information in particular circumstances. A number of such instances have resulted in the assessment of fines and penalties against us. We believe we have multiple legal grounds to satisfy these requests or prevail against associated fines and penalties, and we intend to vigorously defend such fines and penalties. 

Note 13. Stockholders' Equity 

Share Repurchase Program 

Our board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program of our Class A common stock, which commenced in January 2017 and does not have an expiration date. As of December 31, 2022, $ 10.87 billion remained available and authorized for repurchases under this program. In January 2023, an additional $ 40 billion of repurchases was authorized under this program. During the three months ended March 31, 2023, we repurchased and subsequently retired 56 million shares of our Class A common stock for an aggregate amount of $ 9.22 billion, including $ 77 million related to the 1% excise tax on net share repurchases as a result of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. As of March 31, 2023, $ 41.73 billion remained available and authorized for repurchases. 

The timing and actual number of shares repurchased under the repurchase program depend on a variety of factors, including price, general business and market conditions, and other investment opportunities. Shares may be repurchased through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including through the use of trading plans intended to qualify under Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. 

Share-based Compensation Plan 

We have one active share-based employee compensation plan, the 2012 Equity Incentive Plan (Amended 2012 Plan), which was amended in each of June 2016, February 2018, and December 2022. Our Amended 2012 Plan provides for the issuance of incentive and nonqualified stock options, restricted stock awards, stock appreciation rights, RSUs, performance shares, and stock bonuses to qualified employees, directors, and consultants. Shares that are withheld in connection with the net settlement of RSUs or forfeited are added to the reserves of the Amended 2012 Plan. 

Pursuant to the automatic increase provision under our Amended 2012 Plan, the number of shares reserved for issuance increases automatically on January 1 of each of the calendar years during the term of the Amended 2012 Plan, which will continue through April 2026, by a number of shares of Class A common stock equal to the lesser of (i) 2.5 % of the total issued and outstanding shares of our Class A common stock as of the immediately preceding December 31st or (ii) a number of shares determined by our board of directors. Pursuant to this automatic increase provision, our board of directors approved an increase of 56 million shares of Class A common stock reserved for issuance, effective January 1, 2023. 

In December 2022, our board of directors approved an amendment to our Amended 2012 Plan to increase the number of shares reserved for issuance under the Amended 2012 Plan by 425 million shares, effective March 1, 2023 (Plan Amendment). The Plan Amendment was also approved by holders of a majority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock in December 2022. As of March 31, 2023, there were 458 million shares of our Class A common stock reserved for future issuance under our Amended 2012 Plan. 

The following table summarizes our share-based compensation expense, which consists of the company's RSU expense, by line item in our condensed consolidated statements of income (in millions): 

Three Months Ended March 31, 2023 2022 Cost of revenue $ 160 &#160; $ 160 &#160; Research and development 2,449 &#160; 1,941 &#160; Marketing and sales 219 &#160; 216 &#160; General and administrative 223 &#160; 181 &#160; Total share-based compensation expense $ 3,051 &#160; $ 2,498 &#160; 

The following table summarizes the activities for our unvested RSUs for the three months ended March 31, 2023: 

Number of Shares Weighted-Average Grant Date Fair Value Per Share (in thousands) Unvested at December 31, 2022 127,110 &#160; $ 216.93 &#160; Granted 105,156 &#160; $ 196.27 &#160; Vested ( 13,612 ) $ 211.80 &#160; Forfeited ( 3,262 ) $ 229.43 &#160; Unvested at March 31, 2023 215,392 &#160; $ 206.98 &#160; 

The fair value as of the respective vesting dates of RSUs that vested during the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022 was $ 2.44 billion and $ 2.43 billion, respectively. The income tax benefit recognized related to awards vested during the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022 was $ 519 million and $ 514 million, respectively. 

As of March 31, 2023, there was $ 42.84 billion of unrecognized share-based compensation expense related to RSU awards. This unrecognized compensation expense is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately three years based on vesting under the award service conditions. As a result of the 2023 Restructuring related to employees notified in April 2023, approximately 8 million of unvested RSUs as of March 31, 2023, are expected to be forfeited, and $ 1.57 billion of unrecognized share-based compensation expense related to these RSUs awards is not expected to be recognized. 

Note 14. Income Taxes 

Our tax provision for interim periods is determined using an estimated annual effective tax rate, adjusted for discrete items arising in that quarter. In each quarter, we update the estimated annual effective tax rate and make a year-to-date adjustment to the provision. The estimated annual effective tax rate is subject to significant volatility due to several factors, including our ability to accurately predict the proportion of our income (loss) before provision for income taxes in multiple jurisdictions, the U.S. tax benefits from foreign derived intangible income, the effects of tax law changes, the effects of acquisitions, and the integration of those acquisitions. 

Our gross unrecognized tax benefits were $ 10.93 billion and $ 10.76 billion on March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. These unrecognized tax benefits were primarily accrued for the uncertainties related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries, which include licensing of intellectual property, providing services and other transactions, as well as for uncertainties with our research tax credits. If the gross unrecognized tax benefits as of March 31, 2023 were realized in a future period, this would result in a tax benefit of $ 6.62 billion within our provision for income taxes at such time. The amount of interest and penalties accrued was $ 1.18 billion and $ 1.07 billion as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. We expect to continue to accrue unrecognized tax benefits for certain recurring tax positions. 

We are subject to taxation in the United States and various other state and foreign jurisdictions. The material jurisdictions in which we are subject to potential examination include the United States and Ireland. We are under examination by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for our 2014 through 2019 tax years. Our 2020 and subsequent tax years remain open to examination by the IRS and the Irish Revenue Commissioners. 

In July 2016, we received a Statutory Notice of Deficiency (Notice) from the IRS related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries in conjunction with the examination of the 2010 tax year. While the Notice applies only to the 2010 tax year, the IRS stated that it will also apply its position for tax years subsequent to 2010 and has done so in years covered by the second Notice described below. We do not agree with the p osition of the IRS and have filed a petition in the Tax Court challenging the Notice. On January 15, 2020, the IRS's amendment to answer was filed stating that it planned to assert at trial an adjustment that is higher than the adjustment stated in the Notice. The first session of the trial was completed in March 2020 and the final trial session was completed in August 2022. We expect the Tax Court to issue an opinion in 2024. Based 

on t he information provided, we believe that, if the IRS prevails in its updated position, this could result in an additional federal tax liability of an estimated, aggregate amount of up to approximately $ 9.0 billion in excess of the amounts in our originally filed U.S. return, plus interest and any penalties asserted. 

In March 2018, we received a second Notice from the IRS in conjunction with the examination of our 2011 through 2013 tax years. The IRS applied its position from the 2010 tax year to each of these years and also proposed new adjustments related to other transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries and certain tax credits that we claimed. If the IRS prevails in its position for these new adjustments, this could result in an additional federal tax liability of up to approximately $ 680 million in excess of the amounts in our originally filed U.S. returns, plus interest and any penalties asserted. We do not agree with the positions of the IRS in the second Notice and have filed a petition in the Tax Court challenging the second Notice. 

We have previously accrued an estimated unrecognized tax benefit consistent with the guidance in ASC 740, Income Taxes (ASC 740), that is lower than the potential additional federal tax liability from the positions taken by the IRS in the two Notices and its Pretrial Memorandum . In addition, if the IRS prevails in its positions related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries, the additional tax that we would owe would be partially offset by a reduction in the tax that we owe under the mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act . As of March 31, 2023, we have not resolved these matters and proceedings continue in the Tax Court. 

We believe that adequate amounts have been reserved in accordance with ASC 740 for any adjustments to the provision for income taxes or other tax items that may ultimately result from these examinations. The timing of the resolution, settlement, and closure of any audits is highly uncertain, and it is reasonably possible that the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits could significantly change in the next 12 months. Given the number of years remaining that are subject to examination, we are unable to estimate the full range of possible adjustments to the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits. If the tax authorities prevail in the assessment of additional tax due, the assessed tax, interest, and penalties, if any, could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. 

Note 15. Segment and Geographical Information 

We report our financial results for our two reportable segments: Family of Apps (FoA) and Reality Labs (RL). FoA includes Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, WhatsApp, and other services. RL includes augmented and virtual reality related consumer hardware, software, and content. Our operating segments are the same as our reportable segments. 

Revenue and costs and expenses are generally directly attributed to our segments. These costs and expenses include certain product development related operating expenses, costs associated with partnership arrangements, consumer hardware product costs, content costs, and legal-related costs. Indirect costs are allocated to segments based on a reasonable allocation methodology, when such costs are significant to the performance measures of the operating segments. Indirect cost of revenue is allocated to our segments based on usage, such as costs related to the operation of our data centers and technical infrastructure. Indirect operating expenses, such as facilities, information technology, certain shared research and development activities, recruiting, and physical security expenses, are mostly allocated based on headcount. 

The following table sets forth our segment information of revenue and income (loss) from operations (in millions) : 

&#160; Three Months Ended March 31, &#160; 2023 2022 Revenue: Family of Apps $ 28,306 &#160; $ 27,213 &#160; Reality Labs 339 &#160; 695 &#160; Total revenue $ 28,645 &#160; $ 27,908 &#160; Income (loss) from operations: Family of Apps $ 11,219 &#160; $ 11,484 &#160; Reality Labs ( 3,992 ) ( 2,960 ) Total income from operations $ 7,227 &#160; $ 8,524 &#160;

NOTES TO FINANCI AL STATEMENTS 

(Unaudited) 

&#160; 

NOTE 1 &#8212; ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

Accounting Principles 

Our unaudited interim consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;). In the opinion of management, the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments of a normal recurring nature that are necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods presented. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year. The information included in this Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with information included in the Microsoft Corporation fiscal year 2022 Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on July 28, 2022. 

Principles of Consolidation 

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Microsoft Corporation and its subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. 

Estimates and Assumptions 

Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Examples of estimates and assumptions include: for revenue recognition, determining the nature and timing of satisfaction of performance obligations, and determining the standalone selling price (&#8220;SSP&#8221;) of performance obligations, variable consideration, and other obligations such as product returns and refunds; loss contingencies; product warranties; the fair value of and/or potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets for our reporting units; product life cycles; useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets; allowances for doubtful accounts; the market value of, and demand for, our inventory; stock-based compensation forfeiture rates; when technological feasibility is achieved for our products; the potential outcome of uncertain tax positions that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns; and determining the timing and amount of impairments for investments. Actual results and outcomes may differ from management&#8217;s estimates and assumptions due to risks and uncertainties. 

In July 2022, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our server and network equipment. Due to investments in software that increased efficiencies in how we operate our server and network equipment, as well as advances in technology, we determined we should increase the estimated useful lives of both server and network equipment from four years to six years . This change in accounting estimate was effective beginning fiscal year 2023. Based on the carrying amount of server and network equipment included in property and equipment, net as of June 30, 2022, the effect of this change in estimate for the three months ended March 31, 2023 was an increase in operating income of $ 885 million and net income of $ 720 million, or $ 0.10 per both basic and diluted share. The effect of this change for the nine months ended March 31, 2023 was an increase in operating income of $ 2.9 billion and net income of $ 2.3 billion, or $ 0.32 and $ 0.31 per basic and diluted share, respectively. 

Financial Instruments 

Investments 

We consider all highly liquid interest-earning investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. The fair values of these investments approximate their carrying values. In general, investments with original maturities of greater than three months and remaining maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term investments. Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short-term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. 

PART I 

Item 1 

&#160; 

Debt investments are classified as available-for-sale and realized gains and losses are recorded using the specific identification method. Changes in fair value, excluding credit losses and impairments, are recorded in other comprehensive income. Fair value is calculated based on publicly available market information or other estimates determined by management. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, and the extent to which the fair value is less than cost. To determine credit losses, we employ a systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence. In addition, we consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of, and business outlook for, the investee. If we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery, then a decline in fair value below cost is recorded as an impairment charge in other income (expense), net and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments. 

Equity investments with readily determinable fair values are measured at fair value. Equity investments without readily determinable fair values are measured using the equity method or measured at cost with adjustments for observable changes in price or impairments (referred to as the measurement alternative). We perform a qualitative assessment on a periodic basis and recognize an impairment if there are sufficient indicators that the fair value of the investment is less than carrying value. Changes in value are recorded in other income (expense), net. 

Derivatives 

Derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and measured at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. 

For derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, gains and losses are recognized in other income (expense), net with offsetting gains and losses on the hedged items. Gains and losses representing hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in other income (expense), net. 

For derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, gains and losses are initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income and subsequently recognized in other income (expense), net with the corresponding hedged item. Gains and losses representing hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in other income (expense), net. 

For derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges, gains and losses from changes in fair values are primarily recognized in other income (expense), net. 

Fair Value Measurements 

We account for certain assets and liabilities at fair value. The hierarchy below lists three levels of fair value based on the extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market. We categorize each of our fair value measurements in one of these three levels based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. These levels are: 

&#8226; Level 1 &#8211; inputs are based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. Our Level 1 investments include U.S. government securities, common and preferred stock, and mutual funds. Our Level 1 derivative assets and liabilities include those actively traded on exchanges. 

PART I 

Item 1 

&#160; 

&#8226; Level 2 &#8211; inputs are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques (e.g. the Black-Scholes model) for which all significant inputs are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Where applicable, these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market-based observable inputs including interest rate curves, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, and forward and spot prices for currencies. Our Level 2 investments include commercial paper, certificates of deposit, U.S. agency securities, foreign government bonds, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, corporate notes and bonds, and municipal securities. Our Level 2 derivative assets and liabilities include certain cleared swap contracts and over-the-counter forward, option, and swap contracts. 

&#8226; Level 3 &#8211; inputs are generally unobservable and typically reflect management&#8217;s estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The fair values are therefore determined using model-based techniques, including option pricing models and discounted cash flow models. Our Level 3 assets and liabilities include investments in corporate notes and bonds, municipal securities, and goodwill and intangible assets, when they are recorded at fair value due to an impairment charge. Unobservable inputs used in the models are significant to the fair values of the assets and liabilities. 

We measure equity investments without readily determinable fair values on a nonrecurring basis. The fair values of these investments are determined based on valuation techniques using the best information available, and may include quoted market prices, market comparables, and discounted cash flow projections. 

Our other current financial assets and current financial liabilities have fair values that approximate their carrying values. 

Contract Balances and Other Receivables 

As of March 31, 2023 and June 30, 2022, other receivables due from suppliers were $ 717 million and $ 1.0 billion, respectively, and are included in accounts receivable, net in our consolidated balance sheets. 

As of March 31, 2023 and June 30, 2022, long-term accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, was $ 4.3 billion and $ 3.8 billion, respectively, and is included in other long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheets. 

We record financing receivables when we offer certain of our customers the option to acquire our software products and services offerings through a financing program in a limited number of countries. As of March 31, 2023 and June 30, 2022, our financing receivables, net were $ 2.7 billion and $ 4.1 billion, respectively, for short-term and long-term financing receivables, which are included in other current assets and other long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheets. We record an allowance to cover expected losses based on troubled accounts, historical experience, and other currently available evidence. 

Employee Severance 

On January 18, 2023, we announced a decision to reduce our overall workforce by approximately 10,000 jobs through the third quarter of fiscal year 2023. During the three months ended December 31, 2022, we recorded $ 800 million of employee severance expenses related to these job eliminations as part of an ongoing employee benefit plan. These employee severance expenses were included in general and administrative expenses in our consolidated income statements and allocated to our segments based on relative gross margin. Refer to Note 17 &#8211; Segment Information and Geographic Data for further information.

NOTE 2 &#8212; EARNINGS PER SHARE 

Basic earnings per share (&#8220;EPS&#8221;) is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock plus the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method. Dilutive potential common shares include outstanding stock options and stock awards. 

The components of basic and diluted EPS were as follows:

Unrealized losses from fixed-income securities are primarily attributable to changes in interest rates. Management does not believe any remaining unrealized losses represent impairments based on our evaluation of available evidence.

Item 1 

&#160; 

NOTE 5 &#8212; DERIVATIVES 

We use derivative instruments to manage risks related to foreign currencies, interest rates, equity prices, and credit; to enhance investment returns; and to facilitate portfolio diversification. Our objectives for holding derivatives include reducing, eliminating, and efficiently managing the economic impact of these exposures as effectively as possible. Our derivative programs include strategies that both qualify and do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. 

Foreign Currencies 

Certain forecasted transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. We monitor our foreign currency exposures daily to maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions. 

Foreign currency risks related to certain non-U.S. dollar-denominated investments are hedged using foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as fair value hedging instruments. Foreign currency risks related to certain Euro-denominated debt are hedged using foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedging instruments. 

Certain options and forwards not designated as hedging instruments are also used to manage the variability in foreign exchange rates on certain balance sheet amounts and to manage other foreign currency exposures. 

Interest Rate 

Interest rate risks related to certain fixed-rate debt are hedged using interest rate swaps that are designated as fair value hedging instruments to effectively convert the fixed interest rates to floating interest rates. 

Securities held in our fixed-income portfolio are subject to different interest rate risks based on their maturities. We manage the average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain broad-based fixed-income indices using option , futures, and swap contracts. These contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and are included in &#8220;Other contracts&#8221; in the tables below. 

Equity 

Securities held in our equity investments portfolio are subject to market price risk. At times, we may hold options, futures, and swap contracts. These contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and are included in &#8220;Other contracts&#8221; in the tables below. 

Credit 

Our fixed-income portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of investment-grade securities. We use credit default swap contracts to manage credit exposures relative to broad-based indices and to facilitate portfolio diversification. These contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and are included in &#8220;Other contracts&#8221; in the tables below. 

Credit-Risk-Related Contingent Features 

Certain of our counterparty agreements for derivative instruments contain provisions that require our issued and outstanding long-term unsecured debt to maintain an investment grade credit rating and require us to maintain minimum liquidity of $ 1.0 billion. To the extent we fail to meet these requirements, we will be required to post collateral, similar to the standard convention related to over-the-counter derivatives. As of March 31, 2023, our long-term unsecured debt rating was AAA , and cash investments were in excess of $ 1.0 billion. As a result, no collateral was required to be posted.

NOTE 7 &#8212; BUSINESS COMBINATIONS 

Nuance Communications, Inc. 

On March 4, 2022 , we completed our acquisition of Nuance Communications, Inc. (&#8220;Nuance&#8221;) for a total purchase price of $ 18.8 billion, consisting primarily of cash. Nuance is a cloud and artificial intelligence (&#8220;AI&#8221;) software provider with healthcare and enterprise AI experience, and the acquisition will build on our industry-specific cloud offerings. The financial results of Nuance have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the date of the acquisition. Nuance is reported as part of our Intelligent Cloud segment. 

The allocation of the purchase price to goodwill was completed as of December 31, 2022. The major classes of assets and liabilities to which we have allocated the purchase price were as follows:

&#160; 

The measurement periods for the valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed end as soon as information on the facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition dates becomes available, but do not exceed 12 months. Adjustments in purchase price allocations may require a change in the amounts allocated to goodwill during the periods in which the adjustments are determined. 

Any change in the goodwill amounts resulting from foreign currency translations and purchase accounting adjustments are presented as &#8220;Other&#8221; in the table above. Also included in &#8220;Other&#8221; are business dispositions and transfers between segments due to reorganizations, as applicable.

NOTE 11 &#8212; INCOME TAXES 

Effective Tax Rate 

Our effective tax rate was 19 % and 17 % for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and 19 % and 11 % for the nine months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase in our effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the prior year was primarily due to a decrease in tax benefits relating to stock-based compensation. The increase in our effective tax rate for the nine months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the prior year was primarily due to a $ 3.3 billion net income tax benefit in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 related to the transfer of intangible properties and a decrease in tax benefits relating to stock-based compensation. 

In the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, we transferred certain intangible properties from our Puerto Rico subsidiary to the U.S. The transfer of intangible properties resulted in a $ 3.3 billion net income tax benefit in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, as the value of future U.S. tax deductions exceeded the current tax liability from the U.S. global intangible low-taxed income tax. 

Our effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2023, primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations center in Ireland. 

Uncertain Tax Positions 

As of March 31, 2023 and June 30, 2022, unrecognized tax benefits and other income tax liabilities were $ 18.1 billion and $ 16.3 billion, respectively, and are included in long-term income taxes in our consolidated balance sheets. 

We settled a portion of the Internal Revenue Service (&#8220;IRS&#8221;) audit for tax years 2004 to 2006 in fiscal year 2011. In February 2012, the IRS withdrew its 2011 Revenue Agents Report related to unresolved issues for tax years 2004 to 2006 and reopened the audit phase of the examination. We also settled a portion of the IRS audit for tax years 2007 to 2009 in fiscal year 2016, and a portion of the IRS audit for tax years 2010 to 2013 in fiscal year 2018. In the second quarter of fiscal year 2021, we settled an additional portion of the IRS audits for tax years 2004 to 2013 and made a payment of $ 1.7 billion, including tax and interest. We remain under audit for tax years 2004 to 2017 . 

As of March 31, 2023, the primary unresolved issues for the IRS audits relate to transfer pricing, which could have a material impact in our consolidated financial statements when the matters are resolved. We believe our allowances for income tax contingencies are adequate. We have not received a proposed assessment for the unresolved key transfer pricing issues. We do not expect a final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months. Based on the information currently available, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months. 

PART I 

Item 1 

&#160; 

We are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U.S. Our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax years 1996 to 2022 , some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. The resolution of each of these audits is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements.

Revenue allocated to remaining performance obligations, which includes unearned revenue and amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods, was $ 201 billion as of March 31, 2023, of which $ 196 billion is related to the commercial portion of revenue. We expect to recognize approximately 45 % of this revenue over the next 12 months and the remainder thereafter. 

NOTE 13 &#8212; LEASES 

We have operating and finance leases for datacenters, corporate offices, research and development facilities, Microsoft Experience Centers, and certain equipment. Our leases have remaining lease terms of less than 1 year to 18 years, some of which include options to extend the leases for up to 5 years, and some of which include options to terminate the leases within 1 year.

Item 1 

&#160; 

As of March 31, 2023, we have additional operating and finance leases, primarily for datacenters, that have not yet commenced of $ 5.0 billion and $ 21.9 billion, respectively. These operating and finance leases will commence between fiscal year 2023 and fiscal year 2030 with lease terms of 1 year to 18 years. 

NOTE 14 &#8212; CONTINGENCIES 

U.S. Cell Phone Litigation 

Microsoft Mobile Oy, a subsidiary of Microsoft, along with other handset manufacturers and network operators, is a defendant in 46 lawsuits, including 45 lawsuits filed in the Superior Court for the District of Columbia by individual plaintiffs who allege that radio emissions from cellular handsets caused their brain tumors and other adverse health effects. We assumed responsibility for these claims in our agreement to acquire Nokia&#8217;s Devices and Services business and have been substituted for the Nokia defendants. Nine of these cases were filed in 2002 and are consolidated for certain pre-trial proceedings; the remaining cases are stayed. In a separate 2009 decision, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia held that adverse health effect claims arising from the use of cellular handsets that operate within the U.S. Federal Communications Commission radio frequency emission guidelines (&#8220;FCC Guidelines&#8221;) are pre-empted by federal law. The plaintiffs allege that their handsets either operated outside the FCC Guidelines or were manufactured before the FCC Guidelines went into effect. The lawsuits also allege an industry-wide conspiracy to manipulate the science and testing around emission guidelines. 

In 2013, the defendants in the consolidated cases moved to exclude the plaintiffs&#8217; expert evidence of general causation on the basis of flawed scientific methodologies. In 2014, the trial court granted in part and denied in part the defendants&#8217; motion to exclude the plaintiffs&#8217; general causation experts. The defendants filed an interlocutory appeal to the District of Columbia Court of Appeals challenging the standard for evaluating expert scientific evidence. In October 2016, the Court of Appeals issued its decision adopting the standard advocated by the defendants and remanding the cases to the trial court for further proceedings under that standard. The plaintiffs have filed supplemental expert evidence, portions of which were stricken by the court. A hearing on general causation took place in September of 2022. 

Other Contingencies 

We also are subject to a variety of other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. Although management currently believes that resolving claims against us, individually or in aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact in our consolidated financial statements, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management&#8217;s view of these matters may change in the future. 

As of March 31, 2023, we accrued aggregate legal liabilities of $ 177 million. While we intend to defend these matters vigorously, adverse outcomes that we estimate could reach approximately $ 600 million in aggregate beyond recorded amounts are reasonably possible. Were unfavorable final outcomes to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact in our consolidated financial statements for the period in which the effects become reasonably estimable. 

NOTE 15 &#8212; STOCKHOLDERS&#8217; EQUITY 

Share Repurchases 

On September 18, 2019, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing up to $ 40.0 billion in share repurchases. This share repurchase program commenced in February 2020 and was completed in November 2021. 

On September 14, 2021, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing up to $ 60.0 billion in share repurchases. This share repurchase program commenced in November 2021, following completion of the program approved on September 18, 2019, has no expiration date, and may be terminated at any time. As of March 31, 2023, $ 26.9 billion remained of this $ 60.0 billion share repurchase program.

NOTE 17 &#8212; SEGMENT INFORMATION AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA 

In its operation of the business, management, including our chief operating decision maker, who is also our Chief Executive Officer, reviews certain financial information, including segmented internal profit and loss statements prepared on a basis not consistent with GAAP. During the periods presented, we reported our financial performance based on the following segments: Productivity and Business Processes, Intelligent Cloud, and More Personal Computing. 

We have recast certain prior period amounts to conform to the way we internally manage and monitor our business. 

Our reportable segments are described below. 

Productivity and Business Processes 

Our Productivity and Business Processes segment consists of products and services in our portfolio of productivity, communication, and information services, spanning a variety of devices and platforms. This segment primarily comprises: 

&#8226; Office Commercial (Office 365 subscriptions, the Office 365 portion of Microsoft 365 Commercial subscriptions, and Office licensed on-premises), comprising Office, Exchange, SharePoint, Microsoft Teams, Office 365 Security and Compliance, and Microsoft Viva. 

&#8226; Office Consumer, including Microsoft 365 Consumer subscriptions, Office licensed on-premises, and other Office services. 

&#8226; LinkedIn, including Talent Solutions, Marketing Solutions, Premium Subscriptions, and Sales Solutions. 

&#8226; Dynamics business solutions, including Dynamics 365, comprising a set of intelligent, cloud-based applications across ERP, CRM, Customer Insights, Power Apps, and Power Automate; and on-premises ERP and CRM applications. 

Intelligent Cloud 

Our Intelligent Cloud segment consists of our public, private, and hybrid server products and cloud services that can power modern business and developers. This segment primarily comprises: 

&#8226; Server products and cloud services, including Azure and other cloud services; SQL Server, Windows Server, Visual Studio, System Center, and related Client Access Licenses (&#8220;CALs&#8221;); and Nuance and GitHub. 

&#8226; Enterprise Services, including Enterprise Support Services, Microsoft Consulting Services, and Nuance professional services. 

More Personal Computing 

Our More Personal Computing segment consists of products and services that put customers at the center of the experience with our technology. This segment primarily comprises: 

&#8226; Windows, including Windows original equipment manufacturer (&#8220;OEM&#8221;) licensing and other non-volume licensing of the Windows operating system; Windows Commercial, comprising volume licensing of the Windows operating system, Windows cloud services, and other Windows commercial offerings; patent licensing; and Windows Internet of Things.

PART I 

Item 1 

&#160; 

Revenue and costs are generally directly attributed to our segments. However, due to the integrated structure of our business, certain revenue recognized and costs incurred by one segment may benefit other segments. Revenue from certain contracts is allocated among the segments based on the relative value of the underlying products and services, which can include allocation based on actual prices charged, prices when sold separately, or estimated costs plus a profit margin. Cost of revenue is allocated in certain cases based on a relative revenue methodology. Operating expenses that are allocated primarily include those relating to marketing of products and services from which multiple segments benefit and are generally allocated based on relative gross margin. 

In addition, certain costs are incurred at a corporate level and allocated to our segments. These allocated costs generally include legal, including settlements and fines, information technology, human resources, finance, excise taxes, field selling, shared facilities services, customer service and support, and severance incurred as part of a corporate program. Each allocation is measured differently based on the specific facts and circumstances of the costs being allocated and is generally based on relative gross margin or relative headcount. 

Segment revenue and operating income were as follows during the periods presented:

Our Microsoft Cloud revenue, which includes Azure and other cloud services, Office 365 Commercial, the commercial portion of LinkedIn, Dynamics 365, and other commercial cloud properties, was $ 28.5 billion and $ 81.3 billion for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2023, respectively, and $ 23.4 billion and $ 66.3 billion for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2022, respectively. These amounts are primarily included in Server products and cloud services, Office products and cloud services, and LinkedIn in the table above. 

Assets are not allocated to segments for internal reporting presentations. A portion of amortization and depreciation is included with various other costs in an overhead allocation to each segment. It is impracticable for us to separately identify the amount of amortization and depreciation by segment that is included in the measure of segment profit or loss.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGIST ERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Microsoft Corporation 

&#160; 

Results of Review of Interim Financial Information 

We have reviewed the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Microsoft Corporation and subsidiaries (the &#34;Company&#34;) as of March 31, 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, cash flows, and stockholders&#8217; equity for the three-month and nine-month periods ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the &#8220;interim financial information&#8221;). Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the accompanying interim financial information for it to be in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

&#160; 

We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of June 30, 2022, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, cash flows, and stockholders' equity for the year then ended (not presented herein); and in our report dated July 28, 2022, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2022, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the consolidated balance sheet from which it has been derived. 

&#160; 

Basis for Review Results 

This interim financial information is the responsibility of the Company's management. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

&#160; 

We conducted our reviews in accordance with standards of the PCAOB. A review of interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

(unaudited) 

1. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

The accompanying interim consolidated financial statements of Netflix, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries (the &#8220;Company&#8221;) have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (&#8220;U.S.&#8221;) and are consistent in all material respects with those applied in the Company&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#8220;SEC&#8221;) on January 26, 2023. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;) requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the amortization of content assets and the recognition and measurement of income tax assets and liabilities. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that the Company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. On a regular basis, the Company evaluates the assumptions, judgments and estimates. Actual results may differ from these estimates. 

The interim financial information is unaudited, but reflects all normal recurring adjustments that are, in the opinion of management, necessary to fairly present the information set forth herein. The interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in the Company&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of the results for a full year. 

There have been no material changes in the Company&#8217;s significant accounting policies as compared to the significant accounting policies described in the Company&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. 

2. Revenue Recognition 

The Company's primary source of revenues is from monthly membership fees. Members are billed in advance of the start of their monthly membership and revenues are recognized ratably over each monthly membership period. Revenues are presented net of the taxes that are collected from members and remitted to governmental authorities. The Company is the principal in all its relationships where partners, including consumer electronics (&#8220;CE&#8221;) manufacturers, multichannel video programming distributors (&#8220;MVPDs&#8221;), mobile operators and internet service providers (&#8220;ISPs&#8221;), provide access to the service as the Company retains control over service delivery to its members. Typically, payments made to the partners, such as for marketing, are expensed. However, if there is no distinct service provided in exchange for the payments made to the partners or if the price that the member pays is established by the partners and there is no standalone price for the Netflix service (for instance, in a bundle), these payments are recognized as a reduction of revenues. 

The following tables summarize revenues, paid net membership additions, and ending paid memberships by region for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022, respectively: 

United States and Canada (UCAN) 

As of/ Three Months Ended &#160; March 31, 2023 March 31, 2022 &#160; (in thousands) Revenues $ 3,608,645 &#160; $ 3,350,424 &#160; Paid net membership additions (losses) 102 &#160; ( 636 ) Paid memberships at end of period (1) 74,398 &#160; 74,579 &#160; 

Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) 

As of/ Three Months Ended &#160; March 31, 2023 March 31, 2022 &#160; (in thousands) Revenues $ 2,517,641 &#160; $ 2,561,831 &#160; Paid net membership additions (losses) 644 &#160; ( 303 ) Paid memberships at end of period (1) 77,373 &#160; 73,733 &#160; 

Latin America (LATAM) 

As of/ Three Months Ended &#160; March 31, 2023 March 31, 2022 &#160; (in thousands) Revenues $ 1,070,192 &#160; $ 998,948 &#160; Paid net membership additions (losses) ( 450 ) ( 351 ) Paid memberships at end of period (1) 41,249 &#160; 39,610 &#160; 

Asia-Pacific (APAC) 

As of/ Three Months Ended &#160; March 31, 2023 March 31, 2022 &#160; (in thousands) Revenues $ 933,523 &#160; $ 916,754 &#160; Paid net membership additions (losses) 1,455 &#160; 1,087 &#160; Paid memberships at end of period (1) 39,478 &#160; 33,719 &#160; 

(1) A paid membership (also referred to as a paid subscription) is defined as a membership that has the right to receive Netflix service following sign-up and a method of payment being provided, and that is not part of a free trial or certain other promotions that may be offered by the Company to new or rejoining members. Certain members have the option to add extra member sub accounts. These extra member sub accounts are not included in paid memberships. A membership is canceled and ceases to be reflected in the above metrics as of the effective cancellation date. Voluntary cancellations generally become effective at the end of the prepaid membership period. Involuntary cancellations, as a result of a failed method of payment, become effective immediately. Memberships are assigned to territories based on the geographic location used at time of sign-up as determined by the Company&#8217;s internal systems, which utilize industry standard geo-location technology. 

Total U.S. revenues, inclusive of DVD revenues not reported in the tables above, were $ 3.3 billion and $ 3.1 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. DVD revenues were $ 32 million and $ 40 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 

Deferred revenue consists of membership fees billed that have not been recognized, as well as gift cards and other prepaid memberships that have not been fully redeemed. As of March 31, 2023, total deferred revenue was $ 1,262 million, the vast majority of which was related to membership fees billed that are expected to be recognized as revenue within the next month. The remaining deferred revenue balance, which is related to gift cards and other prepaid memberships, will be recognized as revenue over the period of service after redemption, which is expected to occur over the next 12 months. Total deferred revenue as of March 31, 2023 remained relatively flat as compared to the balance of $ 1,265 million as of December 31, 2022. 

3. Earnings Per Share 

Basic earnings per share is computed using the weighted-average number of outstanding shares of common stock during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed using the weighted-average number of outstanding shares of common stock and, when dilutive, potential outstanding shares of common stock during the period. Potential shares of common stock consist of incremental shares issuable upon the assumed exercise of stock options. The computation of earnings per share is as follows: 

Three Months Ended March 31, 2023 March 31, 2022 (in thousands, except per share data) Basic earnings per share: Net income 

$ 1,305,120 &#160; $ 1,597,447 &#160; Shares used in computation: 

Weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding 445,244 &#160; 444,146 &#160; Basic earnings per share $ 2.93 &#160; $ 3.60 &#160; Diluted earnings per share: Net income 

$ 1,305,120 &#160; $ 1,597,447 &#160; Shares used in computation: 

Weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding 445,244 &#160; 444,146 &#160; Employee stock options 7,173 &#160; 8,838 &#160; Weighted-average number of shares 

452,417 &#160; 452,984 &#160; Diluted earnings per share $ 2.88 &#160; $ 3.53 &#160; 

Employee stock options with exercise prices greater than the average market price of the common stock were excluded from the diluted calculation as their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive. The following table summarizes the potential shares of common stock excluded from the diluted calculation: 

Three Months Ended March 31, 2023 March 31, 2022 (in thousands) Employee stock options 5,847 &#160; 2,749 &#160; 

4. Cash, Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash, and Short-term Investments 

The Company&#8217;s investment policy is consistent with the definition of available-for-sale securities. The Company does not buy and hold securities principally for the purpose of selling them in the near future. The Company&#8217;s policy is focused on the preservation of capital, liquidity and return. From time to time, the Company may sell certain securities but the objectives are generally not to generate profits on short-term differences in price. The following tables summarize the Company's cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022: 

&#160; As of March 31, 2023 &#160; Cash and cash equivalents Short-term investments Other Current Assets Non-current Assets Total &#160; (in thousands) Cash $ 3,787,630 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 3,889 &#160; $ 19,483 &#160; $ 3,811,002 &#160; Level 1 securities: Money market funds 2,561,649 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 53 &#160; $ 2,561,702 &#160; Level 2 securities: Time Deposits (1) 365,315 &#160; 1,112,910 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; $ 1,478,225 &#160; $ 6,714,594 &#160; $ 1,112,910 &#160; $ 3,889 &#160; $ 19,536 &#160; $ 7,850,929 &#160; 

&#160; As of December 31, 2022 &#160; Cash and cash equivalents Short-term investments Other Current Assets Non-current Assets Total &#160; (in thousands) Cash $ 4,071,584 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 3,410 &#160; $ 19,874 &#160; $ 4,094,868 &#160; Level 1 securities: Money market funds 569,826 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 122 &#160; 569,948 &#160; Level 2 securities: Time Deposits (1) 505,766 &#160; 911,276 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 1,417,042 &#160; $ 5,147,176 &#160; $ 911,276 &#160; $ 3,410 &#160; $ 19,996 &#160; $ 6,081,858 &#160; 

(1) The majority of the Company's time deposits are domestic deposits, which mature within one year. 

Other current assets include restricted cash for deposits related to self insurance and letter of credit agreements. Non-current assets include restricted cash related to letter of credit agreements. The fair value of cash equivalents and short-term investments included in the Level 2 category is based on observable inputs, such as quoted prices for similar assets at the measurement date; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly. 

See Note 6 Debt to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the fair value of the Company&#8217;s senior notes. 

There were no material gross realized gains or losses in the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 

5. Balance Sheet Components 

Content Assets, Net 

Content assets consisted of the following: 

As of March 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 (in thousands) Licensed content, net

The decrease in Other was primarily driven by receipt of amounts due under a modified content licensing arrangement. 

6. Debt 

As of March 31, 2023, the Company had aggregate outstanding notes of $ 14,437 million, net of $ 76 million of issuance costs, with varying maturities (the ""Notes"").

Each of the Notes are repayable in whole or in part upon the occurrence of a change of control, at the option of the holders, at a purchase price in cash equal to 101 % of the principal plus accrued interest. The Company may redeem the Notes prior to maturity in whole or in part at an amount equal to the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest and an applicable premium. The Notes include, among other terms and conditions, limitations on the Company's ability to create, incur or allow certain liens; enter into sale and lease-back transactions; create, assume, incur or guarantee additional indebtedness of certain of the Company's subsidiaries; and consolidate or merge with, or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all of the Company's and its subsidiaries assets, to another person. As of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company was in compliance with all related covenants. 

Revolving Credit Facility 

On March 6, 2023, the Company amended its $ 1 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (""Revolving Credit Agreement"") to replace the London interbank offered rate to a variable secured overnight financing rate (the &#8220;Term SOFR Rate&#8221;) as the rate to which interest payments are indexed, among other things. The Revolving Credit Agreement matures on June 17, 2026. Revolving loans may be borrowed, repaid and reborrowed until June 17, 2026, at which time all amounts borrowed must be repaid. The Company may use the proceeds of future borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement for working capital and general corporate purposes. As of March 31, 2023, no amounts have been borrowed under the Revolving Credit Agreement. 

The borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement bear interest, at the Company&#8217;s option, of either (i) a floating rate equal to a base rate (the &#8220;Alternate Base Rate&#8221;) or (ii) a rate equal to the Term SOFR Rate (or the applicable benchmark replacement), plus a margin of 0.75 %. The Alternate Base Rate is defined as the greatest of (A) the rate of interest published by the Wall Street Journal, from time to time, as the prime rate, (B) the federal funds rate, plus 0.500 % and (C) the Term SOFR Rate for a one-month tenor, plus 1.00 %. The Term SOFR Rate is the forward-looking secured overnight financing rate administered by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or a successor administrator, for the relevant interest period, but in no event shall the Term SOFR Rate be less than 0.00 % per annum. 

The Company is also obligated to pay a commitment fee on the undrawn amounts of the Revolving Credit Agreement at an annual rate of 0.10 %. The Revolving Credit Agreement requires the Company to comply with certain covenants, including covenants that limit or restrict the ability of the Company&#8217;s subsidiaries to incur debt and limit or restrict the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to grant liens and enter into sale and leaseback transactions; and, in the case of the Company or a guarantor, merge, consolidate, liquidate, dissolve or sell, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole. As of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company was in compliance with all related covenants. 

7. Commitments and Contingencies 

Content 

As of March 31, 2023, the Company had $ 21.5 billion of obligations comprised of $ 4.3 billion included in ""Current content liabilities"" and $ 2.9 billion of ""Non-current content liabilities"" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and $ 14.3 billion of obligations that are not reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as they did not yet meet the criteria for asset recognition. 

As of December 31, 2022, the Company had $ 21.8 billion of obligations comprised of $ 4.5 billion included in ""Current content liabilities"" and $ 3.1 billion of ""Non-current content liabilities"" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and $ 14.2 billion of obligations that are not reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as they did not yet meet the criteria for asset recognition. 

The expected timing of payments for these content obligations is as follows: 

As of March 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 (in thousands) Less than one year 

$ 9,771,665 &#160; $ 10,038,483 &#160; Due after one year and through three years 

9,536,111 &#160; 9,425,551 &#160; Due after three years and through five years 

1,964,812 &#160; 2,124,307 &#160; Due after five years 

253,283 &#160; 243,606 &#160; Total content obligations 

$ 21,525,871 &#160; $ 21,831,947 &#160; 

Content obligations include amounts related to the acquisition, licensing and production of content. Obligations that are in non-U.S. dollar currencies are translated to the U.S. dollar at period end rates. An obligation for the production of content includes non-cancelable commitments under creative talent and employment agreements as well as other production related commitments. An obligation for the acquisition and licensing of content is incurred at the time the Company enters into an agreement to obtain future titles. Once a title becomes available, a content liability is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Certain agreements include the obligation to license rights for unknown future titles, the ultimate quantity and/or fees for which are not yet determinable as of the reporting date. Traditional film output deals, or certain TV series license agreements where the number of seasons to be aired is unknown, are examples of such license agreements. The Company does not include any estimated obligation for these future titles beyond the known minimum amount. However, the unknown obligations are expected to be significant. 

Legal Proceedings 

From time to time, in the normal course of its operations, the Company is subject to litigation matters and claims, including claims relating to employee relations, business practices and patent infringement. Litigation can be expensive and disruptive to normal business operations. Moreover, the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict and the Company's view of these matters may change in the future as the litigation and events related thereto unfold. The Company expenses legal fees as incurred. The Company records a provision for contingent losses when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. An unfavorable outcome to any legal matter, if material, could have an adverse effect on the Company's operations or its financial position, liquidity or results of operations. 

The Company is involved in litigation matters not listed herein but does not consider the matters to be material either individually or in the aggregate at this time. The Company's view of the matters not listed may change in the future as the litigation and events related thereto unfold. 

Indemnification 

In the ordinary course of business, the Company has entered into contractual arrangements under which it has agreed to provide indemnification of varying scope and terms to business partners and other parties with respect to certain matters, including, but not limited to, losses arising out of the Company&#8217;s breach of such agreements and out of intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties. In these circumstances, payment may be conditional on the other party making a claim pursuant to the procedures specified in the particular contract. 

The Company's obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of time or amount, and in some instances, the Company may have recourse against third parties for certain payments. In addition, the Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and certain of its officers that will require it, among other things, to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers. The terms of such obligations vary. 

It is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount of future payments under these or similar agreements due to the conditional nature of the Company&#8217;s obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. No amount has been accrued in the accompanying consolidated financial statements with respect to these indemnification obligations. 

8. Stockholders&#8217; Equity 

Stock Option Plan 

In June 2020, the Company's stockholders approved the 2020 Stock Plan, which was adopted by the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors in March 2020 subject to stockholder approval. The 2020 Stock Plan provides for the grant of incentive stock options to employees and for the grant of non-statutory stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock and restricted stock units to employees, directors and consultants. 

A summary of the activities related to the Company&#8217;s stock option plans is as follows: 

Options Outstanding Shares Available for Grant Number of Shares Weighted- Average Exercise Price (per share) Weighted-Average Remaining Contractual Term (in years) Aggregate Intrinsic Value (in thousands) Balances as of December 31, 2022 16,454,103 &#160; 19,896,861 &#160; $ 242.22 &#160; Granted

The aggregate intrinsic value in the table above represents the total pretax intrinsic value (the difference between the Company&#8217;s closing stock price on the last trading day of the first quarter of 2023 and the exercise price, multiplied by the number of in-the-money options) that would have been received by the option holders had all option holders exercised their options on the last trading day of the first quarter of 2023. This amount changes based on the fair market value of the Company&#8217;s common stock. 

A summary of the amounts related to option exercises, is as follows: 

Three Months Ended March 31, 2023 March 31, 2022 (in thousands) Total intrinsic value of options exercised $ 116,310 &#160; $ 114,762 &#160; Cash received from options exercised 26,028 &#160; 13,678 &#160; 

Stock-based Compensation 

Stock options are generally vested in full upon grant date and exercisable for the full ten year contractual term regardless of employment status. Stock options granted to certain named executive officers vest on the one-year anniversary of the grant date, subject to the employee&#8217;s continuous employment or service with the Company through the vesting date. The following table summarizes the assumptions used to value option grants using the lattice-binomial model and the valuation data:

Stock Repurchases 

In March 2021, the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $ 5 billion of its common stock, with no expiration date. Stock repurchases may be effected through open market repurchases in compliance with Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act, including through the use of trading plans intended to qualify under Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act, privately-negotiated transactions, accelerated stock repurchase plans, block purchases, or other similar purchase techniques and in such amounts as management deems appropriate. The Company is not obligated to repurchase any specific number of shares, and the timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including the Company&#8217;s stock price, general economic, business and market conditions, and alternative investment 

opportunities. The Company may discontinue any repurchases of its common stock at any time without prior notice. During the three months ended March 31, 2023, the Company repurchased 1,222,056 shares for an aggregate amount of $ 400 million. As of March 31, 2023, $ 4.0 billion remain available for repurchases. Shares repurchased by the Company are accounted for when the transaction is settled. As of March 31, 2023, there were no unsettled share repurchases. Direct costs incurred to acquire the shares are included in the total cost of the shares. 

9. Income Taxes 

&#160; Three Months Ended &#160; March 31, 2023 March 31, 2022 &#160; (in thousands, except percentages) Provision for income taxes $ 163,754 &#160; $ 382,245 &#160; Effective tax rate 11 &#160; % 19 &#160; % 

The effective tax rates for the three months ended March 31, 2023 differed from the Federal statutory rate primarily due to the impact of international provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, research and development credits, and the recognition of excess tax benefits of stock-based compensation. The effective tax rates for the three months ended March 31, 2022 differed from the Federal statutory rate primarily due to an increase in foreign taxes, offset by the impact of international provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and the recognition of excess tax benefits of stock-based compensation. 

The decrease in the effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2023, as compared to the same period in 2022 was primarily due to a decrease in foreign taxes. For the three months ended March 31, 2023, the Company recognized a discrete tax benefit related to the excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation of $ 24 million, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2022 of $ 25 million. 

Gross unrecognized tax benefits were $ 234 million and $ 227 million as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. The gross unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized by the Company, will result in a reduction of approximately $ 162 million to the provision for income taxes thereby favorably impacting the Company&#8217;s effective tax rate. 

The Company files U.S. Federal, state and foreign tax returns. The Company is currently under examination by the IRS for the years 2016 through 2018 and is subject to examination for 2019 through 2022. The foreign and state tax returns for the years 2015 through 2022 are subject to examination by various states and foreign jurisdictions. While the Company is in various stages of inquiries and examinations by federal, state and foreign taxing authorities, we believe that our tax positions will more likely than not be sustained. Nonetheless, it is possible that future obligations related to these matters could arise. 

Given the potential outcome of the current examinations as well as the impact of the current examinations on the potential expiration of the statute of limitations, it is reasonably possible that the balance of unrecognized tax benefits could significantly change within the next twelve months. However, an estimate of the range of reasonably possible adjustments cannot be made at this time. 

10. Segment and Geographic Information 

The Company operates as one operating segment. The Company's chief operating decision maker (""CODM"") is its co-chief executive officers, who review financial information presented on a consolidated basis for the purposes of making operating decisions, assessing financial performance and allocating resources. 

Total U.S. revenues were $ 3.3 billion and $ 3.1 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. See Note 2 Revenue Recognition for additional information about streaming revenue by region. 

The Company's long-lived tangible assets, as well as the Company's operating lease right-of-use assets recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, were located as follows: 

As of March 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 (in thousands) United States $ 2,721,743 &#160; $ 2,745,071 &#160; International 866,371 &#160; 880,308 &#160;

Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

Basis of Presentation 

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or U.S. GAAP, for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, Regulation S-X. The January 30, 2022 consolidated balance sheet was derived from our audited consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 30, 2022, as filed with the SEC, but does not include all disclosures required by U.S. GAAP. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments considered necessary for a fair statement of results of operations and financial position, have been included. The results for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for any future period. The following information should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 30, 2022. &#160; 

Significant Accounting Policies 

There have been no material changes to our significant accounting policies disclosed in Note 1 - Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 30, 2022. 

Fiscal Year 

We operate on a 52- or 53-week year, ending on the last Sunday in January. Fiscal years 2023 and 2022 are both 52-week years. The third quarters of fiscal years 2023 and 2022 were both 13-week quarters. 

Reclassifications 

Certain prior fiscal year balances have been reclassified to conform to the current fiscal year presentation. 

Prior period intangible asset gross carrying amount and accumulated amortization in Note 9 have been adjusted to write off immaterial fully amortized intangible assets as of January 30, 2022. 

Principles of Consolidation 

Our condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NVIDIA Corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 

Note 2 - Business Combination 

Termination of the Arm Share Purchase Agreement 

In February 2022, NVIDIA and SoftBank Group Corp, or SoftBank, announced the termination of the Share Purchase Agreement whereby NVIDIA would have acquired Arm Limited from SoftBank. The parties agreed to terminate because of significant regulatory challenges preventing the completion of the transaction. We recorded an acquisition termination cost of $ 1.35 billion in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023 reflecting the write-off of the prepayment provided at signing.

Note 3 - Leases 

Our lease obligations primarily consist of operating leases for our headquarters complex, domestic and international office facilities, and data center space, with lease periods expiring between fiscal years 2023 and 2035. 

Future minimum lease payments under our non-cancelable operating leases as of October 30, 2022 are as follows:

Note 6 &#8211; Income Taxes 

We recognized an income tax benefit of $ 67 million and $ 61 million for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2023, respectively, and an income tax expense of $ 174 million and $ 327 million for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2022, respectively. Income tax as a percentage of income before income tax was a benefit of 10.9 % and 2.1 % for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2023, respectively, and an expense of 6.6 % and 4.6 % for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2022, respectively. 

The decrease in our effective tax rate for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2023 as compared to the same periods of fiscal year 2022 was primarily due to the increased tax benefit of the foreign-derived intangible income deduction, stock-based compensation, and the U.S. federal research tax credit, relative to a lower expected profitability. This is partially offset by the impact of an increase in the proportion of earnings subject to U.S. tax in fiscal year 2023 and the one-time discrete benefit from re-valuing certain deferred tax assets in connection with the domestication of one of our foreign subsidiaries, or the Domestication, in fiscal year 2022. 

Our effective tax rate for the first nine months of fiscal year 2023 was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% due to tax benefits from the foreign-derived intangible income deduction, stock-based compensation and the U.S. federal research tax credit. 

Our effective tax rate for the first nine months of fiscal year 2022 was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% due to tax benefits from the foreign-derived intangible income deduction, income earned in jurisdictions that are subject to taxes lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate, the discrete benefit of the Domestication, and tax benefits related to stock-based compensation and the U.S. federal research tax credit. 

For the first nine months of fiscal year 2023, there were no material changes to our tax years that remain subject to examination by major tax jurisdictions. We are currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service for our fiscal years 2018 and 2019. Additionally, there have been no material changes to our unrecognized tax benefits and any related interest or penalties since the fiscal year ended January 30, 2022.

While we believe that we have adequately provided for all uncertain tax positions, or tax positions where we believe it is not more-likely-than-not that the position will be sustained upon review, amounts asserted by tax authorities could be greater or less than our accrued position. Accordingly, our provisions on federal, state and foreign tax related matters to be recorded in the future may change as revised estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved with the respective tax authorities. As of October 30, 2022, we do not believe that our estimates, as otherwise provided for, on such tax positions will significantly increase or decrease within the next 12 months.

Note 11 - Derivative Financial Instruments 

We enter into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our operating expenses. These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges for hedge accounting treatment. Gains or losses on the contracts are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss and reclassified to operating expense when the related operating expenses are recognized in earnings or ineffectiveness should occur. The fair value of the contracts was not significant as of October 30, 2022 and January 30, 2022. 

We also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency movements on monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. These forward contracts were not designated for hedge accounting treatment. Therefore, the change in fair value of these contracts is recorded in other income or expense and offsets the change in fair value of the hedged foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, which is also recorded in other income or expense. 

The table below presents the notional value of our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding as of October 30, 2022 and January 30, 2022:

In connection with certain agreements that we have entered in the past, we have provided indemnities for matters such as tax, product, and employee liabilities. We have included intellectual property indemnification provisions in our technology-related agreements with third parties. Maximum potential future payments cannot be estimated because many of these agreements do not have a maximum stated liability. We have not recorded any liability in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for such indemnifications. 

Securities Class Action and Derivative Lawsuits 

The plaintiffs in the putative securities class action lawsuit, captioned 4:18-cv-07669-HSG, initially filed on December 21, 2018 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, and titled In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation , filed an amended complaint on May 13, 2020. The amended complaint asserted that NVIDIA and certain NVIDIA executives violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and SEC Rule 10b-5, by making materially false or misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand between May 10, 2017 and November 14, 2018. Plaintiffs also alleged that the NVIDIA executives who they named as defendants violated Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. Plaintiffs sought class certification, an award of unspecified compensatory damages, an award of reasonable costs and expenses, including attorneys&#8217; fees and expert fees, and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper. On March 2, 2021, the district court granted NVIDIA&#8217;s motion to dismiss the complaint without leave to amend, entered judgment in favor of NVIDIA and closed the case. On March 30, 2021, plaintiffs filed an appeal from judgment in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, case number 21-15604. Oral argument on the appeal was held on May 10, 2022.

The putative derivative lawsuit pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, captioned 4:19-cv-00341-HSG, initially filed January 18, 2019 and titled In re NVIDIA Corporation Consolidated Derivative Litigation , was stayed pending resolution of the plaintiffs&#8217; appeal in the In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action. On February 22, 2022, the court administratively closed the case, but stated that it would reopen the case once the appeal in the In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action is resolved. The lawsuit asserts claims, purportedly on behalf of us, against certain officers and directors of the Company for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, waste of corporate assets, and violations of Sections 14(a), 10(b), and 20(a) of the Exchange Act based on the dissemination of allegedly false and misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand. The plaintiffs are seeking unspecified damages and other relief, including reforms and improvements to NVIDIA&#8217;s corporate governance and internal procedures.

Accounting for Loss Contingencies 

As of October 30, 2022, we have not recorded any accrual for contingent liabilities associated with the legal proceedings described above based on our belief that liabilities, while possible, are not probable. Further, except as specifically described above, any possible loss or range of loss in these matters cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. We are engaged in legal actions not described above arising in the ordinary course of business and, while there can be no assurance of favorable outcomes, we believe that the ultimate outcome of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our operating results, liquidity or financial position.

graphics; vGPU software for cloud-based visual and virtual computing; automotive platforms for infotainment systems; and Omniverse software for building 3D designs and virtual worlds. 

Operating results by segment include costs or expenses that are directly attributable to each segment, and costs or expenses that are leveraged across our unified architecture and therefore allocated between our two segments. 

The &#8220;All Other&#8221; category includes the expenses that our CODM does not assign to either Compute &#38; Networking or Graphics for purposes of making operating decisions or assessing financial performance. The expenses include stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related and other costs, corporate infrastructure and support costs, restructuring costs, acquisition termination cost, IP-related and legal settlement costs, contributions, and other non-recurring charges and benefits that our CODM deems to be enterprise in nature. 

Our CODM does not review any information regarding total assets on a reportable segment basis. Depreciation and amortization expense directly attributable to each reportable segment is included in operating results for each segment. However, the CODM does not evaluate depreciation and amortization expense by operating segment and, therefore, it is not separately presented. There is no intersegment revenue. The accounting policies for segment reporting are the same as for our consolidated financial statements. The table below presents details of our reportable segments and the &#8220;All Other&#8221; category.
